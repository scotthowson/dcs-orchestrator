---

DCS Orchestrator deploys, runs and watches your containers. Every stack stays a plain
`docker-compose.yml` that you can read and run by hand. Around it, DCS adds what a homelab or a
small server needs: 200 ready templates, Traefik with wildcard HTTPS, Cloudflare DNS, Authelia
single sign-on, CrowdSec, updates with rollback, backups and a recovery bundle, health scores,
notifications, a Discord bot and a REST API.

Link a Proxmox host and one DCS becomes the **hub**. It builds a VM for each stack, installs
Docker and DCS in it, moves the stack in and then drives the whole host as one machine.

> [!NOTE]
> DCS Orchestrator was called **Docker Compose Skeleton AIO** until 4.0. It is the same project:
> the settings and the API stay the same, and the install directory keeps its old name,
> `~/.Docker-Compose-Skeleton-AIO`, on purpose: the updater and the VMs a hub builds rely on it.

## 🙋 About this project

DCS Orchestrator started as a passion project at home: I wanted one place to run the Docker stacks on my
own server, and it grew from there. Most of the code was written with AI assistance (Claude, through
Claude Code), with me directing the work, testing it on my own machines and deciding what ships. I have
three kids and not all the time in the world, so answers to issues and pull requests may be slow. It
works for me in daily use, but if you run it for other people, read what it does before you trust it
with their data, and keep backups of your own: DCS has backups, snapshots and a recovery bundle
([Operations → Backups](docs/OPERATIONS.md#backups-and-snapshots)), and a restore drill runs in CI, but
nothing replaces a copy you made yourself. Bug reports and contributions are welcome; security problems
go through [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## ✨ Why DCS

| | |
|---|---|
| 📄 **It is just Compose** | A stack is a folder: `Stacks/<name>/docker-compose.yml` and its `.env`. Read it, edit it, run it by hand with `./compose.sh`. Your containers keep running when DCS stops. |
| 🖥️ **The VM is the stack** | On Proxmox, the hub builds one VM per stack and runs exactly that stack in it; the stack's files stay on the hub (`Stacks/<name>/`), pushed into the VM on every save. Proxmox isolates, snapshots and backs up each VM; the hub shows them all as one. |
| 🔋 **Batteries included** | Reverse proxy with HTTPS, DNS records, single sign-on, intrusion detection, updates, backups, health and alerts. The setup wizard wires them up for you. |
| 🎛️ **One place to run it** | A web dashboard (also as Android, Linux and Windows apps), a REST API with 420+ endpoints and a Discord bot, all with the same accounts and roles. |
| 🪶 **Nothing to compile** | The API is a Bash program: a small pool of worker processes behind `socat`; `jq` and Docker Compose do the work. It runs wherever Docker runs. |

## 🚀 Get started

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/img/install-paths.svg" alt="Four ways to install: the hub VM image, an LXC container, any Docker host, or a VM from an installer ISO" width="100%">
</p>

Pick the path that matches what you have:

| You have | Do this | Guide |
|---|---|---|
| A Proxmox host, and you want the full fleet | Import the DCS hub image as a VM *(new in 4.0)* | [A · Hub VM image](docs/GETTING-STARTED.md#a-the-hub-vm-image-on-proxmox) |
| A Proxmox host, and you want the lightest hub | Create a Debian 13 LXC container | [B · Hub in an LXC](docs/INSTALL-LXC.md) |
| Any Linux machine with Docker | `git clone` and `./setup.sh` | [C · Any Docker host](docs/GETTING-STARTED.md#c-any-docker-host) |
| A Proxmox host and an installer ISO | Make a VM, install Debian or Ubuntu, then do C | [D · VM from an ISO](docs/GETTING-STARTED.md#d-a-vm-from-an-installer-iso) |

The quick way, on any Linux machine with Docker:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/scotthowson/dcs-orchestrator.git ~/.Docker-Compose-Skeleton-AIO
cd ~/.Docker-Compose-Skeleton-AIO
./setup.sh
```

`setup.sh` checks Docker and the tools it needs, offers to fix what is missing, starts the API and
the dashboard and prints the address. Open `http://<your-server>:3000` and follow the wizard:
**Connect → Admin → Server → Stacks → Review**. The [first ten minutes](docs/GETTING-STARTED.md#the-first-ten-minutes)
walk you through it.

## 🧭 How it fits together

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/img/architecture.svg" alt="Browser, apps and Discord talk to the hub; the hub runs the dashboard, the API, Traefik, Authelia and CrowdSec, talks to the Proxmox API and drives one member VM per stack" width="100%">
</p>

- **The dashboard** (`DCS-UI`, a container on port 3000) serves the web app and forwards `/api/` to the API.
- **The API** (port 9876) is a small pool of Bash worker processes. It runs `docker compose` in `Stacks/<name>/`,
  writes Traefik routes and Cloudflare records, keeps metrics, schedules and backups, and checks every
  caller's role.
- **The proxy** is a set of templates the wizard deploys for you: Traefik, Authelia and CrowdSec.
- **On a hub**, the API also talks to the Proxmox API and to each **member** (the DCS inside a VM the
  hub built). Pages, the API and the bot act on the whole fleet; the hub's Traefik serves every VM's routes.

## 🧰 Features

<details open>
<summary><b>Stacks and templates</b></summary>

- **Ten ordered stacks.** `core-infrastructure` starts first and stops last; the order is yours to change. [Configuration](docs/CONFIGURATION.md#stacks-and-startup)
- **200 templates.** Jellyfin, Nextcloud, Immich, Home Assistant, Vaultwarden, Grafana and many more, each deployed and watched until healthy before it shipped. [Catalogue](docs/TEMPLATES.md)
- **Deploys that do the plumbing.** A deploy checks ports and the compose file, merges it into the stack, writes the Traefik route and the DNS record and starts it. Undeploy reverses it. [How a template becomes a stack](docs/TEMPLATES.md#how-a-template-becomes-a-stack)
- **Your own templates.** Write one on the Templates page or import one from a URL. [template.json reference](docs/TEMPLATES.md#templatejson-reference)
- **Compose editor with history.** Every save is validated, backed up and can be rolled back. [Operations](docs/OPERATIONS.md#stacks-and-containers)
- **Nuke & reinstall.** Reset a wedged app to a first install; its data goes to a trash folder first. [Operations](docs/OPERATIONS.md#nuke--reinstall)

</details>

<details open>
<summary><b>Proxy, DNS and access</b></summary>

- **Traefik with wildcard HTTPS.** Every app gets `app.your-domain` with a certificate through the Cloudflare DNS challenge. [Configuration](docs/CONFIGURATION.md#proxy-dns-and-domain)
- **Cloudflare DNS.** Records are made for each route and managed on the DNS & Routes page; dynamic DNS follows your public address. [Configuration](docs/CONFIGURATION.md#proxy-dns-and-domain)
- **Authelia single sign-on.** Apps sit behind a login portal with 2FA; apps with their own clients stay open, and you can choose per route. [Templates](docs/TEMPLATES.md#authelia-per-route)
- **CrowdSec.** Attackers are refused at the proxy, with an alert for every ban. [Discord guide](docs/DISCORD.md#2-crowdsec-alerts)
- **Start on demand (Sablier).** Idle apps sleep and wake on the first visit. [Templates](docs/TEMPLATES.md#start-on-demand)
- **Traefik add-ons as switches.** Geoblock with your countries, Cloudflare's real visitor address, theme.park and a maintenance page are switches of the Traefik template, in the wizard and on the deploy sheet; a plugin is declared only while its switch is on. [Templates](docs/TEMPLATES.md#traefik-add-ons)
- **A route feed** for a Traefik on another machine. [Proxmox guide](docs/PROXMOX.md#4-a-traefik-in-another-vm-or-machine-the-route-feed)

</details>

<details open>
<summary><b>Updates, backups and recovery</b></summary>

- **One-click DCS updates** from a release channel, with your edits kept and a rollback tag. [Operations](docs/OPERATIONS.md#updating-dcs)
- **Unattended updates** that roll back by themselves when the health score drops. [Operations](docs/OPERATIONS.md#unattended-updates)
- **Automatic image updates** that pull and recreate only the containers on an older copy. [Operations](docs/OPERATIONS.md#image-updates)
- **Backups and snapshots** of the whole install or one stack, on a schedule; download an archive, upload one kept elsewhere (up to 20 GB, streamed to disk), verify it, and restore it: the data it replaces is set aside first, never overwritten. [Operations](docs/OPERATIONS.md#backups-and-snapshots)
- **A recovery bundle:** one encrypted file that rebuilds the whole install on a new machine. [Operations](docs/OPERATIONS.md#the-recovery-bundle)

</details>

<details open>
<summary><b>Health, alerts and automation</b></summary>

- **A health score** from 0 to 100 for the server, each stack and each container, with history. Containers that sleep on demand (Sablier) count as asleep, not down. [Operations](docs/OPERATIONS.md#health)
- **Needs your attention:** a dashboard card with only what is broken or waiting on you (stopped or unhealthy containers, a VM that does not answer, a missing App-Data drive, a failed or old backup, a full disk, image and DCS updates, waiting OS security updates and a restart the server needs), worst first, each with the page that fixes it.
- **Metrics and trends** kept for up to two years at hourly detail. [Configuration](docs/CONFIGURATION.md#metrics-and-logs)
- **Notifications** to Discord and ntfy with rules and cooldowns, plus generic webhooks. [Discord guide](docs/DISCORD.md)
- **Schedules and automations:** backups, prunes, updates and your own scripts on cron. [Operations](docs/OPERATIONS.md#schedules-and-automations)

<summary><b>Proxmox and the fleet</b></summary>

- **The Proxmox page:** nodes, VMs and LXC containers with live load, power buttons and recent tasks. [Proxmox guide](docs/PROXMOX.md#3-what-you-get)
- **The VM is the stack:** the hub builds a VM per stack from a cloud image or a baked template, and keeps the stack's files (a rebuilt VM gets them back with one push); the VM's `App-Data` shows up next to them on the hub, live (`Stacks/<name>/VM-App-Data`), so an app's own config can be edited from the hub. [Proxmox guide](docs/PROXMOX.md#5-the-fleet-the-vm-is-the-stack)
- **Everything from the hub:** every list page opens on *Everywhere*, with a chip for the hub or one VM. [Proxmox guide](docs/PROXMOX.md#everything-from-the-hub)
- **One version everywhere:** *Update all VMs* hands every member the hub's code. [Proxmox guide](docs/PROXMOX.md#keeping-the-vms-on-the-hubs-version)
- **Bring your own VMs:** any DCS joins the hub with a join code. [Proxmox guide](docs/PROXMOX.md#vms-you-made-yourself)

</details>

<details open>
<summary><b>People, apps and the API</b></summary>

- **Accounts and roles:** admin, viewer and bot, with optional TOTP 2FA and invite-only sign-up; the Users page also sets the second step Authelia asks for at sign-in to your apps (off, every app, or chosen apps). [Operations](docs/OPERATIONS.md#users-and-roles)
- **A Discord bot** with slash commands, buttons and confirmations. [Discord guide](docs/DISCORD.md#3-the-bot)
- **A web terminal**, a file browser, live logs, a topology map and each container's last 30 minutes on the Health page. [Operations](docs/OPERATIONS.md#stacks-and-containers)
- **Themes:** eight built-in looks and a Theme Studio; theme.park themes for your apps. [Operations](docs/OPERATIONS.md#themes)
- **A REST API** with 420+ endpoints, each with its access level. [API reference](docs/API.md)
- **Security by default:** accounts are required off loopback, and a fresh install answers only its setup. [Security](SECURITY.md)

## 💿 VM images <sup>new in 4.0</sup>

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/img/vm-images.svg" alt="Two purpose-built VM images, the hub image and the node image, for Debian 13, Ubuntu 26.04, Fedora 44 and Arch Linux" width="100%">
</p>

DCS 4.0 brings its own VM images (Debian 13, Ubuntu 26.04, Fedora 44 and Arch Linux): small, single-purpose Docker hosts built from `vm-images/`.

- **Node image:** a ready Docker host for the VMs of a fleet. Docker CE with the Compose plugin, the QEMU guest
  agent, ssh with keys only, and a tiny first-boot service that reads the Proxmox cloud-init drive.
- **Hub image:** the node image plus DCS, which starts as a hub on the first boot. Open port 3000 and finish in the wizard.
- **One disk, both firmwares:** each image boots with SeaBIOS or UEFI, and its disk grows to the size you give the VM.

| Node image | Download | On disk | RAM idle, Docker running |
|---|---|---|---|
| Debian 13 | 236 MB | 635 MB | ~140 MB |
| Ubuntu 26.04 LTS | 373 MB | 815 MB | ~190 MB |
| Fedora 44 (SELinux enforcing) | 383 MB | 829 MB | ~210 MB |
| Arch Linux (rolling) | 419 MB | 975 MB | ~180 MB |

<sub>Measured with the images' own boot test (KVM) and on Proxmox 9.2, where each answers ssh about five seconds after `qm start`.
The hub image adds DCS: about 47 MB more to download.</sub>

Every release carries the images, their checksums and `dcs-proxmox.sh`, which puts one on your Proxmox host in a single command
(`bash dcs-proxmox.sh hub debian-13`). The details, and which distribution to pick: [VM images](docs/VM-IMAGES.md); the walk-through:

## 📋 Requirements

| What | Details |
|---|---|
| Operating system | Linux. Setup and the fleet cover Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora and AlmaLinux; `setup.sh` installs missing tools with apt, dnf, yum, pacman, zypper, apk or xbps. |
| Docker | Docker Engine with the Compose v2 plugin |
| Tools | Bash 4+, jq, curl, git, openssl, python3, socat (or ncat) |
| Resources | A hub runs in 2 cores, 4 GB RAM and 32 GB of disk with room to spare. Measured in the LXC test: about 200 MB of RAM and 1.6 GB of disk with the core stack up. |
| Proxmox (optional) | Proxmox VE with an API token; see [Proxmox guide → token](docs/PROXMOX.md#1-make-an-api-token-on-proxmox) |
| Ports | 3000 (dashboard) and 9876 (API) on your network. Neither needs to face the internet: put the dashboard behind Traefik. |

## 🔄 Updating

The **Updates** page shows new releases with their notes and applies them in one click. Your stacks,
templates, accounts and edited files stay as they are, and a backup tag lets you roll back. You can
also let DCS update itself on a schedule, and keep your images fresh the same way.
[Operations → Updating DCS](docs/OPERATIONS.md#updating-dcs) has the details.

By hand, in the install directory:

```bash
git pull --ff-only
sudo systemctl restart dcs-api
```

## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>Is DCS a Kubernetes replacement?</b></summary>

No. There is no scheduler and nothing moves between machines. Each host, or each VM in a fleet,
runs plain Docker Compose. The hub is a control plane over independent Compose hosts: a VM that
loses its hub keeps running its stack.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Do I need Proxmox?</b></summary>

No. DCS runs on any Linux machine with Docker. Proxmox adds the Proxmox page and the fleet, where the
hub builds and drives one VM per stack.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What happens to my containers if DCS stops?</b></summary>

They keep running. Docker runs them with their restart policies, and Traefik keeps serving your
routes. Without the API you lose the dashboard, alerts and schedules until it is back.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I bring my own compose files?</b></summary>

Yes. Put a `docker-compose.yml` into a folder under `Stacks/`, or save it as a template on the
Templates page and deploy it like any other. Work with a stack by hand through `./compose.sh`,
which applies the `.env` files and the secret store the way DCS does.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Is it safe to reach from the internet?</b></summary>

Accounts are required on any network address, and a fresh install answers only its setup until the
first admin exists. Reach the dashboard through Traefik with HTTPS (and Authelia if you like): the
dashboard forwards `/api/`, so port 9876 never needs to be opened. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Should the hub be an LXC container or a VM?</b></summary>

Both work. A VM is the sturdier choice, and it is what Proxmox recommends for Docker. An unprivileged
LXC with nesting uses less memory and was tested for this guide on Proxmox 9.2.
[INSTALL-LXC](docs/INSTALL-LXC.md#lxc-or-vm) explains the difference.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Where does my data live?</b></summary>

Each stack keeps its app data in `Stacks/<stack>/App-Data/`. Settings are in `.env`, secrets are
encrypted in `.secrets/`, accounts are in `.api-auth/`. The recovery bundle packs all of it into one
encrypted file. See [Operations → Backups](docs/OPERATIONS.md#backups-and-snapshots).
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Is there a phone app?</b></summary>

The dashboard works in a phone browser. Every release of the
[dashboard repository](https://github.com/scotthowson/dcs-orchestrator-ui/releases) also ships an
Android APK and Linux and Windows installers.
</details>

## 🤝 Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. Before you open one, run the two test suites:

```bash
tests/lint.sh    # bash -n, shellcheck, compose validation, API reference freshness
tests/smoke.sh   # the API's request handler, driven in a temporary install
```

[Development](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) explains the layout, the tests and how to run the API locally. The
dashboard lives in its own repository: [dcs-orchestrator-ui](https://github.com/scotthowson/dcs-orchestrator-ui).
Please report security problems privately, as [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) describes.
