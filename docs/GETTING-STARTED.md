# Getting started

There are four ways to run DCS. Pick one, install, then read
[the first ten minutes](#the-first-ten-minutes).

<p align="center">
  <img src="img/install-paths.svg" alt="Four ways to install: the hub VM image, an LXC container, any Docker host, or a VM from an installer ISO" width="100%">
</p>

| | A · Hub VM image | B · LXC container | C · Any Docker host | D · VM from an ISO |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Best for** | A new Proxmox fleet | The lightest hub on Proxmox | A single server, a NAS, a cloud VM | Proxmox, your own OS install |
| **You need** | Proxmox, a machine with Docker to build the image | Proxmox | Linux and Docker | Proxmox and a Debian or Ubuntu ISO |
| **Docker comes from** | The image | You install it | You install it | You install it |
| **Status** | New in 4.0 | Tested on Proxmox 9.2 | The classic install | Standard |

> [!TIP]
> Not sure? On Proxmox, take **A** or **D**: a VM is the sturdier home for Docker. Anywhere else, take **C**.

## Before you start

- **An address for the server.** Give the hub a fixed IP address on your LAN. The examples here use
  `192.168.1.20` for the hub and `192.168.1.2` for Proxmox; use your own.
- **A domain (optional).** For `https://app.your-domain` addresses you need a domain on Cloudflare and an
  API token with *Zone → DNS → Edit*. Without a token, Traefik uses the HTTP challenge on port 80 instead.
  You can add both later.
- **A Proxmox API token (for the fleet).** The wizard asks for it. [Link Proxmox](#2-link-proxmox) below
  shows how to make one.

## A. The hub VM image on Proxmox

*New in 4.0.* A ready VM with Docker and DCS inside. It starts DCS as a hub on its first boot, and
you finish in the browser.

**The one command.** Every release carries the eight images, their `SHA256SUMS` and `dcs-proxmox.sh`,
which downloads an image, checks it and makes the VM. On the Proxmox shell, as root:

```bash
curl -fsSLO https://github.com/scotthowson/dcs-orchestrator/releases/latest/download/dcs-proxmox.sh
bash dcs-proxmox.sh hub debian-13 --ip 192.168.1.20/24 --gateway 192.168.1.1 --dns 1.1.1.1
```

It takes your public keys from `/root/.ssh/*.pub` for the user `dcs` (`--ssh-key FILE` names another),
starts the VM and prints its address: carry on at step 5. Every option, and which distribution to pick:
[VM images](VM-IMAGES.md#put-one-on-proxmox). The steps below do the same by hand, from an image you build
yourself.

**1. Build the image.** On any Linux machine with Docker and git. No root needed; the tools run in containers.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/scotthowson/dcs-orchestrator.git
cd dcs-orchestrator
vm-images/build.sh debian-13 hub
```

This writes `vm-images/out/dcs-hub-debian-13.qcow2` and its `.sha256`. Add `--test` to boot the image
in QEMU and check it the way Proxmox runs it (this needs `qemu-system-x86_64`, `qemu-img` and `genisoimage`).

**2. Copy it to the Proxmox host.**

```bash
scp vm-images/out/dcs-hub-debian-13.qcow2 root@192.168.1.2:/root/
```

**3. Create the VM.** On the Proxmox shell, as root. These are the settings the hub itself uses for the
VMs it builds. Change the VM ID (`120`), the storage, the bridge and the addresses to match your host.

```bash
qm create 120 --name dcs-hub --cores 2 --cpu host --memory 4096 --balloon 3072 \
  --net0 virtio,bridge=vmbr0 --scsihw virtio-scsi-single \
  --scsi0 local-lvm:0,import-from=/root/dcs-hub-debian-13.qcow2,discard=on \
  --ide2 local-lvm:cloudinit --boot order=scsi0 --serial0 socket --vga serial0 \
  --agent enabled=1 --ostype l26 --onboot 1 --tags 'dcs;hub'

qm disk resize 120 scsi0 32G
rm /root/dcs-hub-debian-13.qcow2
```

`import-from` copies the image into a new disk on `local-lvm`; after that the file is no longer needed.

**4. Give it a user, a key and an address** through cloud-init, then start it. `--sshkeys` takes a **file on the
Proxmox host** that holds your public ssh key. Proxmox does not make that file for you, so make it first: without it
`qm set` says *can't open '/root/my-key.pub' - No such file or directory*.

On the computer you will ssh from (not on the Proxmox host), look for your key, and make one if there is none (press Enter
at every question):

```bash
ls ~/.ssh/*.pub || ssh-keygen -t ed25519
```

Copy the public half to the Proxmox host as `/root/my-key.pub` (use the file name `ls` showed instead of
`id_ed25519.pub` if yours is different) and look at it there. It is one line that starts with `ssh-ed25519`
(or `ssh-rsa`):

```bash
scp ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub root@192.168.1.2:/root/my-key.pub
ssh root@192.168.1.2 cat /root/my-key.pub
```

No `scp`? Paste the line on the Proxmox shell instead: `echo 'ssh-ed25519 AAAA... you@laptop' > /root/my-key.pub`.

Now the user, the key and the address, and start. The `if` does nothing when the key file is missing or empty, so the
VM is never started without a key:

```bash
if [ -s /root/my-key.pub ]; then
  qm set 120 --ciuser dcs --sshkeys /root/my-key.pub \
    --ipconfig0 ip=192.168.1.20/24,gw=192.168.1.1 --nameserver 1.1.1.1 --ciupgrade 0 && qm start 120
else echo "no key in /root/my-key.pub: copy it there first (see above)"; fi
```

> **Started without a key?** When the file is missing, `qm set` prints *can't open ...* and carries on anyway
> (*generating cloud-init ISO*): the VM gets no key, and ssh takes keys only, so nothing can log in over the network.
> Nothing is lost: make the file as above, run the `qm set` line again, then `qm reboot 120` (it applies the changed
> cloud-init drive, and the image sets up the new key at that boot). Meanwhile `qm terminal 120` opens the VM's serial
> console (press Enter), and a password set with `qm set 120 --cipassword 'choose-one'` logs in there.

**Where the user comes from.** `--ciuser dcs` only *names* the account: the image does not contain it. On its
first boot the image's own small first-boot service reads the cloud-init drive Proxmox attaches and creates the
account (leave `--ciuser` out and it is called `dcs` as well) with the docker group and passwordless `sudo`, installs
your key for it, and sets the host name and the address. You log in as that account, with the private key that
belongs to the public one: `ssh dcs@192.168.1.20`. Password logins over ssh are off. The disk grows to the size
you gave it.

**5. Open the dashboard.** The first boot pulls the dashboard image, so give it a minute. The VM's console
(*Console* in Proxmox) prints the address when DCS is up. Then open:

```text
http://192.168.1.20:3000
```

The wizard waits for its first admin. Carry on with [the first ten minutes](#the-first-ten-minutes).

<details>
<summary><b>What the image does on its first boot</b></summary>

1. `dcs-init` reads the cloud-init drive Proxmox attaches: host name, user, ssh keys, network and DNS.
2. `dcs-hub-init` moves the DCS checkout that came with the image into
   `/home/<user>/.Docker-Compose-Skeleton-AIO` and runs
   `DCS_UNATTENDED=true DCS_FLEET_ROLE=hub ./setup.sh` as that user.
3. It installs the boot services (`dcs-api`, `dcs-stacks`), so DCS comes back after every reboot.
4. It writes the dashboard address to the console and marks itself done. If something was not ready
   (the network, a registry), systemd runs it again 30 seconds later, until it succeeds.

</details>

## B. A hub in an LXC container

An unprivileged Debian 13 container with `nesting=1` and `keyctl=1`, Docker inside, and DCS set up as
a hub. It uses the least memory of the four paths. The full, tested walk-through is its own page:

**→ [Install the hub in an LXC container](INSTALL-LXC.md)**

## C. Any Docker host

Any Linux machine with Docker Engine and the Compose plugin: a spare PC, a NAS, a cloud VM or a VM
you made yourself.

**1. Install Docker** if the machine does not have it yet, and let your user run it:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sudo sh
sudo usermod -aG docker "$USER"
```

Log out and back in (or run `newgrp docker`) so the new group applies.

**2. Get DCS and run the setup** as your normal user, not with `sudo`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/scotthowson/dcs-orchestrator.git ~/.Docker-Compose-Skeleton-AIO
cd ~/.Docker-Compose-Skeleton-AIO
./setup.sh
```

Keep the install in `~/.Docker-Compose-Skeleton-AIO`: the VMs a hub builds use the same path, and
the guides assume it.

**3. Answer its questions.** `setup.sh` first checks the machine, then:

- asks how this DCS will be used: **Standalone** (the default), **Hub** (link Proxmox here) or
  **Member** (a hub's address and a join code) — a **node**, the API alone managed from a hub, is
  not asked for here: one line from the hub installs it, see [a node](#a-node-a-vm-the-hub-manages);
- offers to install missing tools (`jq`, `socat`, `curl` and friends), to start Docker and to add you
  to the `docker` group, and carries on in the same run;
- on a Proxmox guest, looks for the Proxmox API and offers to link it;
- creates `.env`, the stack folders and the logs folder, starts the API on port 9876 and the dashboard
  on port 3000;
- offers the boot services, so DCS starts by itself after a reboot.

When it finishes it prints the dashboard's address:

```text
  ║   Open your browser to complete setup:                  ║
  ║                                                         ║
  ║   Local:   http://localhost:3000                        ║
  ║   Network: http://192.168.1.20:3000                     ║
```

<details>
<summary><b>Unattended install (no questions)</b></summary>

For scripts and images, `setup.sh` takes its answers from the environment. This starts a hub and
leaves the first admin to the wizard:

```bash
DCS_UNATTENDED=true DCS_FLEET_ROLE=hub ./setup.sh
```

This creates the admin as well and finishes the setup without the wizard:

```bash
DCS_UNATTENDED=true DCS_ADMIN_USER=admin DCS_ADMIN_PASSWORD='choose-a-long-one' \
  DCS_TZ=Europe/London DCS_PROXY_DOMAIN=example.com ./setup.sh
```

Unattended runs never change the system without being told: they do not install tools or packages,
and they do not install the boot services (run `sudo .scripts/install-service.sh` afterwards).
Every variable is listed in `./setup.sh --help` and in [Configuration](CONFIGURATION.md#setup-variables).

</details>

### A node: a VM the hub manages

A VM that is to run stacks under a hub needs no dashboard, no accounts and no wizard of its own:
it is a **node** (`DCS_ROLE=node`), the API alone, and the hub's dashboard manages it. On the
hub, open the **Proxmox** page → **Join code** and copy the line it shows; run it on the VM as a
user with sudo (`sudo -v` first if sudo asks for a password, or as root):

```bash
curl -fsSL 'http://192.168.1.20:9876/fleet/bootstrap?token=ABCD-EFGH-JKLM' | bash
```

That installs Docker and the tools if they are missing (Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora or Arch), fetches
DCS from the hub, sets it up as a node, joins the hub — the join creates the hub's account on the
node, the only one it will have — and installs the boot services. The VM then shows on the hub's
Stacks page like a VM the hub built, carrying a stack named like the machine. Nothing is left to
do on the VM: the first-admin step of path C belongs to a hub, and a node refuses it.

## D. A VM from an installer ISO

The classic way on Proxmox: a VM you install yourself, then path C inside it.

1. **Get the ISO.** In Proxmox: *Datacenter → your node → local → ISO Images → Download from URL*, and paste
   the Debian 13 netinst link from [debian.org](https://www.debian.org/distrib/netinst) (or an Ubuntu Server ISO).
2. **Create the VM** (*Create VM*):
   - *OS*: the ISO, type Linux.
   - *System*: SCSI controller **VirtIO SCSI single**, tick **QEMU Agent**.
   - *Disks*: 32 GB, tick **Discard**.
   - *CPU*: 2 cores, type **host**. *Memory*: 4096 MB.
   - *Network*: **VirtIO** on your bridge (`vmbr0`).
   - *Confirm*: tick **Start after created**. Later, under *Options*, set **Start at boot** to Yes.
3. **Install the OS.** Choose *SSH server* and *standard system utilities*, no desktop. Create your user.
4. **Prepare it** as root in the VM's console:

   ```bash
   apt-get update && apt-get install -y sudo qemu-guest-agent curl git
   usermod -aG sudo youruser
   systemctl enable --now qemu-guest-agent
   ```

   The guest agent lets Proxmox read the VM's address, shut it down cleanly and freeze the file system
   for backups; the hub also uses it to find VMs.
5. **Install Docker and DCS** as your user: follow [C. Any Docker host](#c-any-docker-host) from step 1 for a
   hub or a standalone server. For a node of a hub, [the one line](#a-node-a-vm-the-hub-manages) from the hub's
   Join code card does the whole step, Docker included.

With Proxmox linked, DCS tags its own VM `dcs` and `hub` in Proxmox when the wizard finishes *(new in 4.0)*.

## The first ten minutes

### 1. Walk through the wizard

Open `http://<server>:3000`. The setup wizard has five steps.

| Step | What you do |
|---|---|
| **Connect** | The dashboard finds its API by itself and shows what it detected: host name, time zone, Docker and Compose versions, user and group IDs. |
| **Admin** | Create the first admin account (at least 8 characters, with an uppercase letter and a number). Moving house? *Restore a recovery bundle* here instead. |
| **Server** | Name, time zone, domain, data folder, user and group IDs. Notifications (ntfy, Discord), Traefik with its add-ons (start on demand, Cloudflare real IP, Geoblock, theme.park, maintenance mode), Authelia and CrowdSec, dynamic DNS. On a Proxmox guest a **Proxmox** section opens by itself. Anywhere but on a hub, *Join a DCS hub* makes this server a member. |
| **Stacks** | The stacks to create and their start order. On a hub with Proxmox linked, each stack has a **Hub / VM** switch with its size, and a VM settings panel. |
| **Review** | Check everything, then **Complete Setup**. The wizard deploys the proxy services, makes the DNS records, starts the core stack and, on a hub, hands the VM plan over. |

You land on the dashboard. Everything the wizard set is in *Config* and can be changed later.

### 2. Link Proxmox

Skip this without Proxmox. DCS talks to Proxmox with an **API token**, never a password. On the
Proxmox shell:

```bash
pveum role add DCS -privs "VM.Audit VM.PowerMgmt Sys.Audit"
pveum user add dcs@pve
pveum aclmod / -user dcs@pve -role DCS
pveum user token add dcs@pve dcs -privsep 0      # prints the secret once
```

In the wizard's Proxmox section, or later in *Config → Proxmox*, enter the address
(`https://192.168.1.2:8006`), the token ID `dcs@pve!dcs` and the secret, then press **Test connection**.
The secret goes into the encrypted secret store.

This token sees and powers guests. **To build VMs**, the token also needs the roles *PVEVMAdmin*,
*PVEDatastoreAdmin* and *PVESDNUser* on `/`:

```bash
pveum aclmod / -user dcs@pve -role PVEVMAdmin
pveum aclmod / -user dcs@pve -role PVEDatastoreAdmin
pveum aclmod / -user dcs@pve -role PVESDNUser
```

And to hand a folder of the Proxmox host (a media library) to a VM from the dashboard —
[Host folders](PROXMOX.md#a-folder-of-the-proxmox-host-inside-a-vm-media-libraries):

```bash
pveum acl modify /mapping/dir --users dcs@pve --roles PVEMappingAdmin
```

[Proxmox guide → token](PROXMOX.md#1-make-an-api-token-on-proxmox) covers the web UI way and every
privilege. The Proxmox page says what the token may do (`GET /proxmox/capabilities`).

### 3. Deploy your first app

1. Open **Templates** and pick one, for example *Uptime Kuma*.
2. Press **Deploy**. Choose the stack it lands in, check the variables (ports, paths, passwords), and
   decide per route whether it sits behind Authelia and whether it starts on demand.
3. Watch the progress: pull, create, start, health check. When it is healthy, open it at its port or at
   `https://<name>.<your-domain>`.

The same from the API:

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -X POST http://localhost:9876/templates/uptime-kuma/deploy \
  -d '{"target_stack":"monitoring-management","auto_start":true}'
```

[Templates](TEMPLATES.md) lists every template and explains what a deploy does.

### 4. Build your first VM

On a hub with Proxmox linked (and a token that may build VMs):

1. Open the **Proxmox** page and choose **New VM stack**, or on the **Stacks** page choose
   **New stack → In its own VM**.
2. Name the stack, pick a size (*Small* to *X-Large*, or set cores, memory and disk) and the operating
   system. Keep **Bake a DCS template first** ticked: the first build makes a template, and every later
   VM is a quick clone of it.
3. Follow the build card: *Image → Create → Cloud-init → Boot → SSH → Install → Join → Stack → Ready*.
   A failed step says why and has a **Retry**.

The new VM shows up as a stack on the Stacks page (with a *VM* chip), its containers on the Containers
page, and its routes behind the hub's Traefik. [Proxmox guide → the fleet](PROXMOX.md#5-the-fleet-the-vm-is-the-stack)
explains every step.

### 5. Make it survive a reboot

If you skipped it during setup, install the boot services:

```bash
sudo ~/.Docker-Compose-Skeleton-AIO/.scripts/install-service.sh
```

`dcs-api` starts the API after Docker; `dcs-stacks` starts your stacks in order, checks their health and
repairs Traefik's routes after a power cut.
