## Setup

| Symptom | Cause and fix |
|---|---|
| *Run ./setup.sh as your normal user, not with sudo.* | Setup run with `sudo` would leave files owned by root and start the API as root. Run it as your user, who needs to be in the `docker` group: `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`, log out and in, run `./setup.sh` again. |
| *Docker is NOT installed on this system.* | Install Docker Engine with the Compose plugin (`curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com \| sudo sh`), then run `./setup.sh` again. |
| *Docker is installed, but its service is not running*, or *may not use Docker yet* | Setup offers both fixes on a terminal and carries on. By hand: `sudo systemctl enable --now docker`, `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`, then log out and in (or `newgrp docker`) and run `./setup.sh` again. |
| *The API server needs tools this system does not have yet* | Setup offers to install them on a terminal. An unattended run never installs anything: install `jq`, `socat`, `curl`, `git`, `openssl` and `python3` first. |
| *API server failed to start* | `logs/api-server.log` names the process that holds the port. Stop it, or set another `API_PORT` in `.env`. |
| Setup prints *Containers from an earlier install — the core infrastructure starts anew* on a brand-new machine | Harmless: with Docker 29, setup's check mistakes a missing container for an old one and starts the dashboard with `--force-recreate`. The dashboard comes up as normal. |
| The dashboard container is *unhealthy*, its log says `socketpair() failed (13: Permission denied)` | Debian's own `docker.io` 26 with AppArmor 4 blocks nginx. Setup (3.9.1 and later) writes `DCS_UI_APPARMOR=unconfined` into `Stacks/core-infrastructure/.env`. On an older install add that line and run `./compose.sh core-infrastructure up -d dcs-ui`, or install Docker CE, which needs nothing. |
| In an LXC container: `failed to mount … fstype: overlay … permission denied` | The container lacks nesting. On the Proxmox host: `pct set <id> --features nesting=1,keyctl=1`, then restart it. [INSTALL-LXC](INSTALL-LXC.md#caveats) |
| Fedora: containers cannot write their `App-Data`; Traefik cannot read the Docker socket | Fedora's own Docker package confines containers with SELinux. Setup offers to run them the way Docker CE does (SELinux stays on for the rest of the system). Or keep it and add `:z` to every volume. |
| Fedora: the hub's VMs cannot join, or a build stops at *Install* with *could not fetch the DCS bundle* | firewalld blocks the API port. `sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=9876/tcp && sudo firewall-cmd --reload`, then *Retry*. |

## The dashboard and the API

| Symptom | Cause and fix |
|---|---|
| The wizard never appears, or the dashboard flips between *Connection Unstable* and *Connection Restored* | The browser tab holds a session from an earlier install. Reload the page (Ctrl+Shift+R) or sign out. |
| The dashboard shows **Not answering**, **Reconnecting…** or **Offline** *(4.0)* | The API does not answer. On the server: `systemctl status dcs-api`, `curl -s http://127.0.0.1:9876/ping`, and the end of `logs/api-server.log` or `journalctl -u dcs-api -n 50`. |
| Everything but the setup answers `401` | No admin exists yet: a fresh install answers only its setup. Finish the wizard. |
| The dashboard is gone after a reboot | The API ran from setup, outside systemd. Install the boot services: `sudo .scripts/install-service.sh`. |
| The dashboard behind Traefik answers `502` after changing `DCS_UI_PORT` | That setting moves only the host port. Traefik reaches the container over the proxy network, so its route must keep `http://DCS-UI:3000`. |
| A viewer account gets `403` on an action | By design: only admins change things. The [API reference](API.md) lists every route's access level. |
| The phone or desktop app cannot connect from outside | Type the dashboard's address (`https://ui.<your-domain>`) into the app's Connect screen: it finds the `/api` path by itself. Port 9876 never needs to be opened to the internet. |

## Stacks, containers and templates

| Symptom | Cause and fix |
|---|---|
| `The "SECRETS_…" variable is not set` when you run `docker compose` by hand | Only DCS resolves `${SECRETS_…}` references. Use `./compose.sh <stack> …`, which applies the `.env` files and the secret store. |
| A stack will not start: *references secrets that do not exist* | The compose or `.env` names a `${SECRETS_…}` value the store does not have. Add it on the Secrets page and start again. |
| A deploy is refused: *Host port conflict* or *Host port(s) already in use* | Another service already publishes that port. Several templates share a default port (Jellyfin and FreshRSS on 8096, Kavita and pgAdmin on 5050, and so on), and the placeholder services of a fresh clone use 8080 to 8082. Pick another port on the deploy sheet. |
| *Singleton template … is already deployed* | It may run once per server. Use the one you have, or replace it (`replace_services: true`). |
| *Protecting a route needs Authelia* | Deploy the Authelia template first, or switch the route's Authelia switch off. |
| *Start on demand needs Sablier* | Deploy the Sablier template first. It is not offered for a stack that lives in a VM. |
| An app answers without the Authelia portal | Templates whose apps bring their own clients (*Own sign-in* in the [catalogue](TEMPLATES.md#the-catalogue)) stay open on purpose. The deploy sheet's switch decides otherwise. |
| *Run Command* on the Containers page stops after 30 seconds | It runs without a terminal and with its input closed, so interactive programs (`ollama run`, editors, shells) end or time out. Use the Terminal page. |
| The hub's CPU sits at 100 % or more with a dashboard open (a small VM) | Every request is a bash process; before 4.0.5 each one read the whole API script. Update: the API keeps worker processes (`API_WORKERS`, see [Configuration](CONFIGURATION.md)), and the dashboard polls less often. Close dashboard tabs you do not use; a hub likes 4 vCPUs. |
| The dashboard keeps losing the API ("reconnecting") on 4.0.5 or 4.0.6, mostly with VMs that are off or deleted | The worker pool queued requests behind slow ones and behind the dashboard's open event stream. Update to 4.0.7 or later (the pool is a fast path there: a stream or a request without a free worker gets a process of its own), and remove VMs that no longer exist from the fleet (Proxmox page → the member → *Remove from the fleet*, or *Delete* on their stack). |
| A settings file was replaced by an empty one, and a `…corrupt-<time>` file appeared | An empty or broken state file (after a crash) is set aside and replaced by an empty default, with an entry in the audit log. The old file is there to inspect. |

## Proxy, DNS and certificates

| Symptom | Cause and fix |
|---|---|
| After a power cut Traefik is up but no site answers | The stacks came up before Traefik could load its plugins or reach the Docker socket. The boot service (`start.sh --boot`) probes every route once the stacks are healthy and restarts Traefik if none answer. `GET /routes/health` shows the probe; `POST /routes/reconcile` runs it now. |
| The browser warns about the certificate, or Cloudflare answers `526` | Traefik has no certificate yet. With a Cloudflare token it uses the DNS challenge; without one, port 80 must reach Traefik for the HTTP challenge. The **Certificates** panel on *DNS & Routes* (`GET /routes/certificates`) shows the challenge, every certificate and the last ACME errors. |
| Traefik answers `404` for an app | The route names a middleware or service that does not exist, or another domain. The same Certificates panel probes every route and names the usual cause. |
| CrowdSec banned your own address (the site works on the phone, not on the PC) | The **Protection** card on the dashboard has *Unban me* and *Trust my address*. Your public address is whitelisted every ten minutes; `CROWDSEC_TRUSTED_IPS` pins more. |
| CrowdSec banned somebody just for using Jellyfin (or another media app) | The alert says `http-crawl-non_statics` or `http-probing`: one page of the web client makes dozens of requests. `CROWDSEC_MEDIA_APPS` (default `jellyfin`) names the apps whose answered requests, missing media and own 403s are not counted, also through a VM of the fleet: [media apps](CROWDSEC.md#media-apps-a-web-client-is-not-a-crawler). Banned at home on your own server: your device went out over IPv6, see [the home network over IPv6](CROWDSEC.md#the-home-network-over-ipv6). |
| DNS records are missing or wrong | The *DNS & Routes* page manages the Cloudflare zone and links each record to the route that uses it; *Create N missing* makes the records routes lack. Keep the token as the secret `CF_DNS_API_TOKEN`. |

## Updates

| Symptom | Cause and fix |
|---|---|
| The Updates page says the install *cannot fast-forward* (diverged) | It carries commits the release does not have. Press **Align**: the stack files are copied aside and put back, the code moves to the release, a backup tag allows a rollback. Do not run `git reset --hard` by hand: before 4.0.58 git tracked the stack files and that put the skeleton over every one of them. |
| The nightly image update says *stack file does not describe its running containers, left alone* | The stack's `docker-compose.yml` no longer names every service that runs from it (a stub, a file cut short) or does not render. Nothing was recreated. Restore the file (Stacks page history, `.data/update-backups/<stamp>/Stacks/`, a backup), then run the image update again. |
| The update stops: *local changes to framework files would be overwritten* | You edited a file DCS ships. Tick the box to replace it (your copy is kept in `.data/update-backups/`), or undo the edit. |
| Fedora: after an update the API does not start; `journalctl -u dcs-api` says `203/EXEC` | SELinux: the new script lost its `bin_t` label. 3.9.9 and later put it back by themselves. By hand: `chcon -t bin_t ~/.Docker-Compose-Skeleton-AIO/.scripts/api-server.sh && sudo systemctl restart dcs-api`, and run `sudo .scripts/install-service.sh` once. |
| An image update reported success but the containers kept the old image | Fixed in 3.9.9: updates now recreate the containers on an older copy. Update DCS, then press *Recreate* on the Updates page. |
| An unattended update rolled itself back | The health score dropped by more than `UPDATE_ROLLBACK_DROP` within `UPDATE_HEALTH_GRACE` seconds. The Updates page lists the attempt and why; update by hand and watch what fails. |

## Proxmox and the fleet

| Symptom | Cause and fix |
|---|---|
| *Proxmox rejected the API token* (401) | The token ID must be `user@realm!name`; the secret is the UUID shown when the token was made. |
| *The API token lacks permission* (403) | Give `VM.Audit`, `VM.PowerMgmt` and `Sys.Audit` on `/`, to the user (privilege separation off) or to the token. Building VMs needs more: [the roles](PROXMOX.md#building-the-vms). |
| *did not answer* | Use the address of the Proxmox web UI, `https://<host>:8006`. Switch *Verify certificate* off for the self-signed certificate. |
| A VM build fails at a step | Each step's failures and fixes are in the [Proxmox guide](PROXMOX.md#7-troubleshooting): *Image*, *Create*, *SSH*, *Install*, *Join*, *Stack*. *Retry* resumes where it stopped. |
| A VM's memory shows near 100 % while it idles | Without a memory balloon Proxmox shows its whole allocation. VMs the hub builds get one; for an older VM use *Enable ballooning* in its sheet and reboot it. |
| `Stacks/<name>/VM-App-Data` on the hub holds only `NOT-MOUNTED.txt` | That link shows the VM's App-Data while it is mounted; the file says why it is not (the VM is off, the stack has made no App-Data yet, `sshfs` is missing on the hub, the VM does not take the hub's ssh key). *Mount* on the stack's page tries at once. The causes one by one: [the Proxmox guide](PROXMOX.md#7-troubleshooting). |
| *Nuke & reinstall* lists the App-Data folders as *missing* and the app keeps its old files (before 4.0.11) | The folders were looked for in the wrong place where every stack keeps its own `./App-Data` (the default). Update the server that runs the container - on a hub, *Update VMs* too. |
| A VM's events do not reach the hub's Discord or ntfy | The member has no relay token yet; the hub hands one out within a minute of reaching it. |
| A VM you set up by hand never shows on the hub, although `setup.sh` said *Join saved* | A full DCS without an admin saves its join for its own setup wizard, which nobody opens on a VM that only runs stacks. Make the VM a node instead: the one line on the hub's Proxmox page (*Join code*), `curl -fsSL 'http://<hub>:9876/fleet/bootstrap?token=<code>' \| bash`, installs it as the API alone and joins at once — see [Proxmox → VMs you made yourself](PROXMOX.md#vms-you-made-yourself). A node's own address answers 403 *this is a node of …* to a browser: that is right, the hub's dashboard is where it is managed. |

## Finding out more

- `logs/` holds the API's log (`api-server.log`), stack actions (`stack-actions.log`), image updates
  (`image-update.log`) and the framework's own logs.
- `journalctl -u dcs-api -f` and `journalctl -u dcs-stacks` follow the boot services.
- `.scripts/config-validator.sh` checks the installation; `--fix` repairs what it can.
- `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG ./start.sh`, or `./start.sh --debug` for a full trace.
- The **Diagnostics** page shows the port map and a health matrix; `GET /health` the same as JSON.
- Still stuck? Open an issue with `cat VERSION`, what you did and what you saw. Report security problems
  privately, as [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md) describes.
