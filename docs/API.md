# DCS API reference

Generated from the router in `.scripts/api-server.sh` by `.scripts/api-docs.sh` — do not edit by hand.
Run `.scripts/api-docs.sh` after adding or changing a route; CI fails when this file is stale.

The API listens on `API_BIND:API_PORT` (default `0.0.0.0:9876`) and answers JSON.
Every endpoint below is `420` in total.

## Access levels

| Level | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| public | No token needed (setup, login, health of the API itself). |
| user | Any authenticated account. Users are viewers: they read operational data and manage their own session and profile. |
| admin | Accounts with the admin role. Everything that changes the system, runs code or exposes secrets. |

Send the session token as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. `POST /auth/setup` creates the first (admin) account on a fresh install; until it exists, only the setup endpoints and `GET /version` answer.

## Usage

```bash
API=http://localhost:9876

# First run: create the admin account (returns a session token)
curl -s -X POST "$API/auth/setup" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"username":"admin","password":"correct horse battery staple"}'

# Log in later
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST "$API/auth/login" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"username":"admin","password":"correct horse battery staple"}' | jq -r .token)
AUTH="Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

curl -s -H "$AUTH" "$API/status" | jq .            # host and Docker overview
curl -s -H "$AUTH" "$API/stacks" | jq .            # stacks and their containers
curl -s -H "$AUTH" -X POST "$API/stacks/media-services/start"

# Deploy a template into a stack and start it
curl -s -H "$AUTH" -X POST "$API/templates/jellyfin/deploy" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"target_stack":"media-services","auto_start":true,"variables":{"PUID":"1000"}}'

# Preview the same deployment without touching anything
curl -s -H "$AUTH" -X POST "$API/templates/jellyfin/dry-run" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"target_stack":"media-services"}' | jq .

# Live events and metrics (Server-Sent Events; EventSource clients pass the token as ?token=)
curl -N -H "$AUTH" "$API/stream"

# Invite a read-only viewer
CODE=$(curl -s -H "$AUTH" -X POST "$API/auth/invite" -d '{"role":"user"}' | jq -r .code)
curl -s -X POST "$API/auth/register" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d "{\"username\":\"viewer\",\"password\":\"another strong passphrase\",\"invite_code\":\"$CODE\"}"
```

Errors are JSON too: `{"error": true, "code": 403, "message": "Admin access required"}`.
Rate limiting answers `429`; a fresh install answers `401` with a message pointing at `POST /auth/setup`.

| GET | `/fleet/members/{id}/folders` | user | The folders of the Proxmox host a VM of the fleet has (virtiofs): what Proxmox maps, what the VM is given, where the VM mounts it and which containers use it; whether the token may share folders (it needs the role PVEMappingAdmin on /mapping/dir) and the steps under way. ?op=1: the steps alone (for polling) |

| POST | `/proxmox/vms/{node}/{type}/{vmid}/{action}` | admin | Power action on a VM or container: start, shutdown, stop, reboot, reset (VMs only), balloon (VMs only: a memory balloon whose floor keeps the guest three quarters of its memory, so Proxmox reports the guest's real usage and can take a little back; reboot afterwards), suspend, resume — audited and sent to the webhooks |

| POST | `/fleet/hub/domain` | admin | The hub hands this member the fleet's proxy domain {domain, force}: written as PROXY_DOMAIN when this DCS has none yet (or the example.com placeholder), so the routes it writes for its stacks carry the fleet's domain; a domain of its own (a Traefik here) is kept unless force is true |
| POST | `/domains` | admin | Add a domain {domain}: one Cloudflare token covers it; it gets its wildcard certificate, its sign-in (auth.<domain>) and its apex record (admin) |
| POST | `/domains/vm-default` | admin | The domain new VMs get {domain} ("" = this server's own) (admin) |
| POST | `/fleet/members/{id}/domain` | admin | The VM answers under another of the hub's domains {domain} ("" = the hub's own): its routes move to it at once (admin) |
| POST | `/fleet/docker-engine/update` | admin | Bring the Docker Engine up to date on members {members: ["id", …] or "all"} (each VM the hub built has passwordless sudo, so no password travels); the answer says what each member started |
| POST | `/fleet/jobs/{id}/retry` | admin | Run a failed VM job again from the step that failed |
| POST | `/fleet/members/{id}/relink` | admin | Take a VM back after its password was lost (a deleted FLEET_MEMBER_*_PASSWORD secret, a changed dcs-hub account): the hub lifts its own lock-out on the VM, joins the VM again over ssh with a fresh join code, and keeps the new password; the VM's stacks, placement and settings stay as they were {} (admin session; answers manual_command when the hub's ssh key does not open the VM) |
| POST | `/fleet/members/{id}/test` | admin | Log in to the member afresh, read its identity and version, and say which guest it matches |
| POST | `/fleet/members/{id}/sync` | admin | Pull the files of every stack a VM runs into the hub's Stacks/ folders; {direction: "push"} sends the hub's copies into the VM instead; {stacks: [names]} limits it. The answer lists what moved and what failed |
| POST | `/fleet/members/{id}/terminal/exec` | admin | Run a shell command inside a VM over the hub's ssh key {terminal_token, command, cwd?}: the hub's own Terminal session unlocks it; the same command guard, rate limit, 60 s limit and audit log as the host terminal |
| POST | `/fleet/members/{id}/api/{path}` | admin | Forward the call (GET, POST, PUT or DELETE) to that member with the hub's account; the caller's own role is checked against the inner path as if it were local (streams and auth are not forwarded) |
| POST | `/fleet/members/{id}/backups/upload` | admin | Upload a backup archive into a VM's BACKUP_DEST_DIR through the hub (the body and ?filename= as POST /backups/upload takes them): streamed on to the VM as it arrives, nothing of it kept on the hub; the VM's limit and free room are asked first, and the VM checks it as it checks its own uploads |
| POST | `/fleet/members/{id}/folders` | admin | Share a folder of the Proxmox host with a VM {name, path?, mount?, readonly?, restart?}: the mapping on Proxmox (made from path when name is new), the virtiofs device on the VM, a restart of the VM when it runs (restart: false leaves that to you), the mount in the VM (default /mnt/<name>) and a restart of the stacks that already name the folder. Answers at once (202); GET …/folders?op=1 follows the steps |
| POST | `/fleet/members/{id}/folders/*/mount` | admin | Mount a folder the VM was given, in the VM, now {mount?, readonly?}: the line in its /etc/fstab and the mount (after a VM that was off is started, or to change read-only); the stacks that name the folder are restarted |
| POST | `/fleet/members/{id}/folders/*/use` | admin | Mount a folder the VM was given, in the VM, now {mount?, readonly?}: the line in its /etc/fstab and the mount (after a VM that was off is started, or to change read-only); the stacks that name the folder are restarted |
| POST | `/power/sample` | admin | Read the UPS right now (also refreshes what GET /power shows) |
| POST | `/sablier/repair` | admin | Recreate on-demand containers that a prune removed (created, not started, so Sablier can wake them) |
| POST | `/feed/token` | admin | Switch the dashboard feed on: makes a new token (the one before stops working) and answers it once (admin) |
| POST | `/themes` | admin | Store a theme: the document itself {schema: 1, name, title, mode, palette: {accent, accentSecondary, bg, surface, surfaceRaised, border, text, textMuted, success, warning, danger, info}, font, radius, css}; replaces a theme of the same name; CSS that loads or runs something is cut out and reported (stripped) |
| POST | `/themes/import` | admin | Fetch a theme document from an https address {url, replace} (256 KB at most) and store it; 409 when the name is taken and replace is not true |
| POST | `/recovery/bundle` | admin | Write an encrypted recovery bundle now {passphrase?, include_app_data: [stacks], copy_remote} |
| POST | `/recovery/restore` | admin | Restore a bundle from this box {file, passphrase, confirm, restart}: the configuration is replaced (a pre-restore snapshot is kept); the stacks whose App-Data it holds are stopped, their App-Data set aside (.data/pre-restore, or <path>.before-restore-<time> on a drive), restored, and started again |
| POST | `/recovery/upload` | admin | Store a recovery bundle: the file itself as the body (application/octet-stream, ?filename=&sha256=, at most API_MAX_BACKUP_UPLOAD_SIZE, streamed to disk; 507 when there is no room) or, from an older dashboard, JSON {filename, content_b64} (at most API_MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE). Kept only when it is whole and an encrypted bundle |
| POST | `/fleet/images/check` | admin | Registry check on the hub and on every member at once (each compares digests with its registries, no pulls); the answer counts per DCS |
| PUT | `/themes/active` | admin | The theme every dashboard follows {name} ("" = the default look); it must be stored here first |
| PUT | `/fleet/members/{id}/api/{path}` | admin | Forward the call (GET, POST, PUT or DELETE) to that member with the hub's account; the caller's own role is checked against the inner path as if it were local (streams and auth are not forwarded) |
| PUT | `/fleet/members/{id}` | admin | Change a member's name, address, account, the guest it is mapped to, or the stacks it answers for {name?, url?, username?, password?, vmid?, node?, type?, insecure?, stacks?: ["name", …]} (a placement makes the hub forward that stack's requests to this member; a stack the hub runs itself cannot be placed) |
| DELETE | `/themes/{name}` | admin | Remove a stored theme (dashboards following it go back to the default look) |
| DELETE | `/feed/token` | admin | Switch the dashboard feed off: the token is removed and both addresses answer 401 (admin) |
| DELETE | `/fleet/members/{id}/api/{path}` | admin | Forward the call (GET, POST, PUT or DELETE) to that member with the hub's account; the caller's own role is checked against the inner path as if it were local (streams and auth are not forwarded) |
| DELETE | `/fleet/members/{id}/folders/*` | admin | Take a shared folder from a VM (?restart=false leaves the VM running: the device goes at its next start; ?mapping=true also removes the mapping from Proxmox): unmounted in the VM and out of its /etc/fstab, the device off the VM. Answers at once (202); nothing is deleted on the host |
| DELETE | `/domains/*` | admin | Take a domain off this server: no VM may still use it (admin) |
| DELETE | `/fleet/members/{id}` | admin | Forget a member (its dcs-hub account is removed there when it answers) |
| DELETE | `/fleet/templates/{vmid}` | admin | Forget a DCS template and destroy the template VM on Proxmox |
| DELETE | `/fleet/jobs/{id}` | admin | Forget a finished or failed job; ?destroy=true also destroys the VM a failed build (or a by-hand install that never joined) left behind |
| DELETE | `/fleet/join-tokens/{token}` | admin | Revoke a join code |
| DELETE | `/fleet/hub` | admin | Leave the hub: forget it and remove its dcs-hub account here (the hub drops this member when it next fails to answer, or when removed there) |
| DELETE | `/ssh/keys/*` | admin | Take a key away: its line is removed from every VM (and the hub) it was put on (admin) |
