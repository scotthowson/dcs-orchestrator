# Templates

A template is a ready Compose service with a form around it. Pick one, fill in a few fields, and DCS
merges it into a stack, gives it a route, a DNS record and a login portal, and starts it. Every template
was deployed and watched until healthy before it shipped, and each description says what to do after
the first start.

- [How a template becomes a stack](#how-a-template-becomes-a-stack)
- [Authelia per route](#authelia-per-route)
- [Start on demand](#start-on-demand)
- [Traefik add-ons](#traefik-add-ons)
- [Templates in a fleet](#templates-in-a-fleet)
- [The catalogue](#the-catalogue)
- [template.json reference](#templatejson-reference)
- [Keeping this page up to date](#keeping-this-page-up-to-date)

## How a template becomes a stack

1. **Choose.** On the **Templates** page, open a card and press **Deploy** (admins only).
2. **Fill in the deploy sheet.**
   - *Stack*: where it lands. The template's own stack is preselected.
   - *Variables*: ports, paths, passwords. Defaults come from the template; an empty secret is filled with
     64 random hex characters.
   - *Optional services*: parts you can leave out, such as Traefik's Docker socket proxy.
   - *Per route*: behind Authelia or not, start on demand or not, and whether to add it to Homarr.
3. **Preview** (optional). The preview lists name and port conflicts, the variables and anything the
   security scan found, without changing a thing.
4. **Deploy.** DCS works through these steps, and stops with the reason when one fails:

   | Step | What happens |
   |---|---|
   | Variables | Required ones checked; values with line breaks or shell characters refused; empty secrets generated |
   | Security scan | The compose is checked for privileged mode, host namespaces, dangerous mounts and capabilities |
   | Conflicts | A second copy of a one-per-host template is refused, and so are clashing service names and host ports |
   | Merge | The stack's `docker-compose.yml` is backed up, the services, volumes and networks are merged in, and the result is validated (the backup comes back if it is invalid); new variables go to the stack's `.env` |
   | Config files | The template's `config/` files are copied into the app's `App-Data` folder, never over files that exist |
   | Route and DNS | A Traefik route for `<name>.<your-domain>`, a Cloudflare record, the Authelia and Sablier middlewares you chose, a Homarr tile if asked |
   | Start | The new services are pulled, created and started, and followed until they are healthy |

5. **Use it.** Open it at its port or at `https://<name>.<your-domain>`. The container's page has its logs,
   *Run Command*, its environment and **Nuke & reinstall**.

**Undeploy** takes the template's services out of the stack and removes their containers. On request it
also removes their data, their images and their routes.

The same from the API, with an admin token:

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -X POST http://localhost:9876/templates/jellyfin/deploy \
  -d '{"target_stack":"media-services","auto_start":true,"variables":{"MEDIA_PATH":"/srv/media"}}'
```

Other fields the deploy takes: `exclude_services`, `container_names` (`{service: name}`),
`authelia_services`, `on_demand_services`, `add_to_homarr`, `replace_services`, `gpu` (a graphics card's PCI slot from
`GET /status` → `system.gpus[].slot`, for templates with a `gpu` list). `POST /templates/{name}/dry-run`
is the preview, `POST /templates/{name}/undeploy` the way back. [API reference](API.md#templates) has them all.

## Authelia per route

Once the **Authelia** template is deployed, every new route goes behind its login portal (with 2FA),
unless you say otherwise:

- Templates whose apps bring their own clients stay open by default: Plex, Jellyfin, Nextcloud, Immich,
  Vaultwarden, the \*arr apps, ntfy, Gitea, MinIO and others. The catalogue marks them **Own sign-in**
  (`"auth": "bypass"` in their `template.json`), because a phone app or a TV cannot pass a web portal.
- The deploy sheet has a switch per route, and its choice always wins.
- Routes that existed before Authelia was deployed go behind it when it arrives.

Protecting a route needs Authelia first; without it the deploy answers *Protecting a route needs
Authelia: deploy the Authelia template first*.

## Start on demand

With the **Sablier** template deployed, an app can sleep while nobody uses it and wake on the first visit.
The Traefik template's *Start containers on demand* switch deploys Sablier with Traefik, into the same stack.

- Choose it per service on the deploy sheet, or later with **Start on demand** on the container's page.
- Pick how long it may idle (5 minutes to 12 hours) and the waiting page visitors see (ghost, shuffle,
  hacker-terminal, matrix).
- DCS puts the Sablier middleware last in the route's chain, so a visitor passes CrowdSec and Authelia
  before anything wakes up.
- Health, the Containers page, the stack cards and the Discord bot show such apps as **asleep** (on
  demand), not stopped: they count in no health score, raise no "container stopped" alert, and prunes
  leave them alone. What does stand out is an on-demand container whose Sablier is not running.

## Traefik add-ons

The Traefik template has five switches, on the Traefik step of the setup wizard and on its deploy sheet
(`TRAEFIK_*` variables in the API). Each one declares a Traefik plugin and sets up what uses it. Traefik
downloads every plugin its static config declares when it starts, and does not start at all when one
cannot be fetched, so a plugin is declared only while its switch is on.

| Switch | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Start containers on demand** (`TRAEFIK_SABLIER`) | Deploys the Sablier template into the same stack, started with Traefik (a Sablier that runs already is left alone), and declares its plugin. [Start on demand](#start-on-demand) has the rest. |
| **Cloudflare real IP** (`TRAEFIK_CLOUDFLARE_REAL_IP`) | For a site behind Cloudflare's proxy: the `cloudflarewarp` middleware goes first in `traefik-chain`, so the CrowdSec bouncer, Geoblock and the apps see the visitor's address and scheme, not Cloudflare's. Leave it off when Cloudflare only serves your DNS. |
| **Geoblock** (`TRAEFIK_GEOBLOCK`, `TRAEFIK_GEOBLOCK_COUNTRIES`) | Only visitors from the countries you list reach the routes DCS writes; everyone else gets 403. The list is ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes, comma separated (`GB,US,DE`; the UK is `GB`), checked before anything is written. Your LAN is always let in; a country is looked up at geojs.io once and cached. The `geoblock` middleware sits in `traefik-chain`. |
| **theme.park themes** (`TRAEFIK_THEMEPARK`) | Declares the theme.park plugin at the start, so a theme put on an app's pages from its container page needs no Traefik restart. |
| **Maintenance mode** (`TRAEFIK_MAINTENANCE`) | Declares the maintenance plugin and defines a `maintenance` middleware with a holding page (`App-Data/Traefik/maintenance.html`, yours to edit). It is defined, not attached: add `"maintenance"` to a route's middlewares, and the page shows there, with a 503, while `App-Data/Traefik/maintenance.trigger` exists. `touch` the trigger to start, remove it to stop; no restart either way. |

`traefik-chain` is on every route DCS writes, so what goes into it covers them all: `cloudflarewarp`
first, then the CrowdSec bouncer and `geoblock`, then the redirect and the security headers. The
middlewares DCS writes for the add-ons are files of their own beside the chain
(`App-Data/Traefik/custom_routes/<stack>/geoblock.yml`, `cloudflarewarp.yml`, `maintenance.yml`).

Deploying the template again changes the switches. Such a deploy rewrites what DCS wrote and takes out
what DCS wrote, nothing else: a `geoblock` middleware you defined yourself, and its place in the chain,
stay. The proxy stack's `.env` remembers the switches, so a deploy that does not mention them keeps them
as they are, and a running Traefik restarts when its static config changed. Turning Sablier off leaves
its service in the stack; undeploy the Sablier template to remove it.

In Traefik's static config the plugins sit between `# dcs-if: TRAEFIK_…` and `# dcs-end` markers, which
DCS keeps in step with the switches. A `traefik.yml` from before the markers gets a plugin added under
`experimental.plugins` when its switch is on, and a flow that needs a plugin on the spot (a theme from a
container's page, *Start on demand*) turns its block on and records the switch in the stack's `.env`.

## Templates in a fleet

On a hub, the deploy sheet also lists the stacks that live in VMs. A deploy into one of them goes to
that VM's DCS, with your own role checked on the hub first. The hub's Traefik serves the new route, and
the hub keeps your Authelia choice for it. *Start on demand* is not offered for a VM's stack: Sablier runs
on the hub and can only wake the hub's own containers. **Deploy here** on the Proxmox page opens the
sheet with that VM's stack chosen.

## The catalogue

**Port** is the default host port to open (you can change it when you deploy). **Stack** is where the
template lands unless you pick another. **Notes**: *Own sign-in* stays out of Authelia by default,
*One per host* can be deployed once per server, *Not routed* services keep a plain port (games, voice,
MQTT, DNS), *Optional* services can be left out.

## Hardening and pinned images

DCS's own containers (the core stack, and the `traefik`, `crowdsec`, `authelia`, `docker-socket-proxy`, `sablier` and
`discord-bot` templates) follow three rules a new core template follows too:

- **A pinned line, never `:latest`.** The minor tag where the image publishes one (`traefik:v3.7`, `authelia/authelia:4.39`,
  `redis:7.4-alpine`), the release where it does not (`crowdsecurity/crowdsec:v1.8.1`). Check that the tag exists on the
  registry (`docker manifest inspect IMAGE:TAG`); the image updates then follow the line ([Operations](OPERATIONS.md#image-updates)).
- **`security_opt: [no-new-privileges:true]`, `cap_drop: [ALL]`** and only the capabilities the container needs, each one
  named with its reason in a comment (`NET_BIND_SERVICE` for a port below 1024, `DAC_OVERRIDE` for a root process writing
  App-Data, which belongs to PUID after the deploy, `SETUID`/`SETGID` for an entrypoint that drops to its own user).
- **`read_only: true`** with a `tmpfs` for `/tmp` (and `/run`) where the image writes nothing else; where it does (CrowdSec's
  hub, Authelia's `/app/.healthcheck.env`, the dashboard's nginx config) the comment says why it is not read-only.
  `label:disable` only where a host path cannot be relabelled (CrowdSec reading `/var/log`, the socket proxy).

`tests/lint.sh` fails when a service of `Stacks/*/docker-compose.yml` or of the crowdsec, traefik and authelia templates
lacks `no-new-privileges:true`, and counts the app templates that lack it as a warning. The app templates keep their
`:latest` tags and are not hardened by default.

## template.json reference

Every template is a folder under `.templates/` with a `docker-compose.yml`, a `template.json` and, when
the app needs files before its first start, a `config/` folder. A `files/` folder holds what DCS writes
itself at deploy time (the CrowdSec bouncer's middleware, the Traefik add-ons' middlewares); it is not
copied as it is.

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `name`, `title`, `description`, `icon`, `tags` | What the gallery shows. The description should say what to do after the first start (default logins, where to click). |
| `category` | The gallery group: `media`, `monitoring`, `web`, `databases`, `development`, `tools`, `productivity`, `automation`, `security`, `network`, `storage`, `download`, `entertainment`. The dashboard also takes aliases such as `notes`, `photos`, `vpn`, `backup`, `ai` and `gaming`. |
| `target_stack` | The stack it lands in by default. |
| `variables[]` | The deploy form: `name`, `label`, `description`, `default`, `required`. `type: "password"` hides the value; `type: "boolean"` makes a switch (the value is `true` or `false`); `options: [{value, label}]` makes a picker; `show_if: {OTHER_VAR: "value"}` hides a field until another one matches; `generate: "hex64"` fills an empty value with 64 random hex characters. |
| `config_path` | The folder under the stack's `App-Data/` that receives the template's `config/` files before the first start. `${VAR:-default}` placeholders in `.yml`, `.yaml`, `.conf` and `.env` files are filled from the deploy variables. A block between `# dcs-if: VAR` and `# dcs-end` lines is uncommented when the variable `VAR` is true (`true`, `yes`, `on`, `1`) and commented out when it is not, on every deploy: a plugin or a middleware declared only while its switch is on. |
| `route_skip` | Services that get no Traefik route, DNS record or proxy network: game, voice, MQTT and DNS ports. Services without a published port, or bound to `127.0.0.1`, are skipped anyway. |
| `route_override` | `{subdomain, port, protocol, use_host_ip, container}` for an app whose routable service is not in the compose file (Nextcloud AIO). |
| `singleton` | `true` when only one copy may run on a server (Traefik, Portainer, Watchtower…). |
| `optional_services` | `[{service, label, description, default_enabled}]`: services the deploy sheet can leave out (`exclude_services` in the API). |
| `gpu` | `[{service, use, images}]`: services that can use one of the server's graphics cards, picked on the deploy sheet. `use` is `compute` (AI: on AMD the service also gets `/dev/kfd`) or `video` (transcoding). AMD and Intel cards give the service their render node at the same path (`/dev/dri/renderD129`) and the host's `video` and `render` groups; NVIDIA a GPU reservation (the NVIDIA Container Toolkit must be installed). `images` swaps the image for a vendor, such as `{"amd": "ollama/ollama:rocm"}`. A stack whose services use the server's graphics card is not moved into a VM. |
| `auth` | `"bypass"`: the app's own clients sign in directly, so its routes stay out of Authelia unless the deploy sheet says otherwise. `auth_note` explains why on the sheet. |

Compose files use `${APP_DATA_DIR:-./App-Data}/<Name>/…` bind mounts, so *Nuke & reinstall*, backups and
the file editor find the data; `${PUID}`, `${PGID}` and `${TZ}` from the root `.env`; and a `healthcheck`
wherever the image has a tool to run one. `tests/lint.sh` validates every template's compose file with
its own defaults.

## Keeping this page up to date

The catalogue above is generated from `.templates/*/template.json`. After adding or changing a template:

```bash
docs/tools/gen-templates.sh            # rewrite the catalogue
docs/tools/gen-templates.sh --check    # exit 1 when this page is out of date
```

The script needs `bash` and `jq`, only touches the part between the two markers, and changes nothing
when it runs twice.
