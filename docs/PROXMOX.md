DCS runs anywhere Docker runs. On a Proxmox host it can also **see and power the VMs and
containers around it**, and it fits a layout where every Docker VM runs its own DCS and one hub
shows them all. This guide covers every piece, from the API token to the Traefik on another VM.

![DCS on Proxmox — hub, members and the proxy](proxmox-architecture.png)

Nothing in this picture is required: a single-host install is the same DCS with one box.

---

## The three ways DCS meets Proxmox

| | What it means | Where it lives |
|---|---|---|
| **DCS inside a VM or LXC** | The normal install. `./setup.sh` notices it runs on a QEMU/KVM guest or in an LXC container and offers to link Proxmox right away. | Any Docker VM or container on the host |
| **Linked to the Proxmox API** | The Proxmox page lists nodes, VMs and LXC containers with live CPU, memory and uptime, starts, shuts down, stops, reboots and resets them, and alerts when a guest stops on its own. The Discord bot gets `/vms` and `/vm`. | Any DCS, single-host or hub |
| **The fleet: the VM is the stack** | One DCS in its own small LXC or VM (the **hub**) keeps the dashboard, the Proxmox link and `core-infrastructure`. Every other stack is a VM the hub **builds** (cloud image, Docker, DCS, joined) and that runs exactly that stack: `media-services` is a VM named media-services. The hub's own API answers for all of them, so the Stacks, Containers and Templates pages, the bot and the API work across the whole host as if it were one machine. | The hub in its own LXC/VM (see *Recommended layout*) |

All three ship. Section 5 sets up the hub and its members; nothing about it changes how a
single-host DCS works.

---

## 1. Make an API token on Proxmox

DCS talks to Proxmox with an **API token**, never with a password. The token needs three
privileges on the root path `/`: `VM.Audit` (see guests), `VM.PowerMgmt` (start, stop,
reboot) and `Sys.Audit` (node status and version).

### From the web UI

1. **Datacenter → Permissions → Users → Add**: user `dcs`, realm *Proxmox VE authentication
   server* (`pve`). Any password; it is never used.
2. **Datacenter → Permissions → Roles → Create**: name `DCS`, privileges `VM.Audit`,
   `VM.PowerMgmt`, `Sys.Audit`.
3. **Datacenter → Permissions → Add → User Permission**: path `/`, user `dcs@pve`, role `DCS`,
   *Propagate* ticked.
4. **Datacenter → Permissions → API Tokens → Add**: user `dcs@pve`, token ID `dcs`, **untick
   Privilege Separation** (so the token inherits the user's permissions). Copy the **secret**:
   it is shown once.

The token ID DCS asks for is `dcs@pve!dcs` (user, realm, `!`, token name).

### From the Proxmox shell

```bash
pveum role add DCS -privs "VM.Audit VM.PowerMgmt Sys.Audit"
pveum user add dcs@pve
pveum aclmod / -user dcs@pve -role DCS
pveum user token add dcs@pve dcs -privsep 0      # prints the secret once
```

To let DCS also see storage and tasks of the whole cluster add `Datastore.Audit`; nothing
else is needed. A token with *Privilege Separation* on works too if you give **the token** the
`DCS` role at `/` instead of the user.

---

## 2. Link DCS to Proxmox

Three places do the same thing; use whichever you are at.

**`./setup.sh`** — when it runs inside a Proxmox guest it prints what it found:

```
  [INFO]  Machine: QEMU/KVM virtual machine — most likely a Proxmox VM
  [INFO]  Proxmox API found at https://192.168.1.2:8006
  Link DCS to this Proxmox now? [y/N]
```

Answer `y`, confirm the URL, paste the token ID and secret. Setup tests the token and writes
`PROXMOX_URL`, `PROXMOX_TOKEN_ID`, `PROXMOX_TOKEN_SECRET` (and `PROXMOX_VERIFY_TLS=false` when
Proxmox still uses its self-signed certificate) to `.env`. Say `n` to do it later.

- **The address** can be typed any way: `192.168.1.2`, `http://192.168.1.2:8006/` or the
  address bar of the Proxmox web UI (`https://192.168.1.2:8006/#v1:0:…`) all become
  `https://192.168.1.2:8006`. On 8006 Proxmox answers plain HTTP with a redirect only, so
  `http://` never works as is; setup (and the dashboard's forms) take the https address.
- **The secret** shows as `***` while you type or paste it, and setup says how many
  characters it got. It is the UUID Proxmox shows once, when the token is made;
  `dcs@pve!dcs=<secret>` pasted into the token ID fills both.
- **A refused token or a wrong address** is asked again (three rounds, an empty line skips),
  with the reason. A token that works but lacks `VM.Audit`, `VM.PowerMgmt` or `Sys.Audit` on
  `/` is named right away: with *Privilege Separation* ticked, the token itself needs the role.

**The setup wizard** — the *Server* step shows a **Proxmox** section, opened automatically on a
Proxmox guest with the detected URL filled in. *Test connection* checks the token before you
continue; the review page lists the result. On a hub (*Hub* chosen in `./setup.sh`, kept as
`FLEET_ROLE` in `.env`) the section says so, and a link setup saved is filled in and tested as
soon as you have signed in — the secret stays on the server (leave its field empty to keep it),
and the *Stacks* step starts with every stack as a VM.

**Config → Proxmox** — on an existing install: URL (`https://pve.example.com:8006`),
token ID, secret, *Verify certificate* (off for the self-signed one), an optional *Only this
node* filter, and *Test connection*. The URL and token ID go to the root `.env`; the **secret is
kept in the secret store** under `PROXMOX_TOKEN_SECRET` (Secrets page) — never in plain text —
and the store always wins over a `PROXMOX_TOKEN_SECRET` line in `.env`.

The certificate: Proxmox ships self-signed. Either switch *Verify certificate* off, or give
Proxmox a real certificate (Datacenter → ACME) and keep verification on.

---

## 3. What you get

### The Proxmox page

- **Nodes** — every node with status, CPU, memory and root-disk bars, uptime and its guest
  count.
- **VMs & containers** — each guest with its state, VMID, type (VM or LXC), node, CPU, memory,
  uptime and tags. Filter by state or type, search by name, ID, node or tag.
- **Power** (admins) — *Start* for a stopped guest; *Shut down* (clean ACPI or container stop),
  *Reboot*, *Stop* (hard) and, for VMs, *Reset* and *Suspend* for a running one; *Resume* for a
  paused one. Every action asks first and explains what it does.
- **Recent tasks** — starts, stops, backups and migrations with who ran them and how they ended.
- **A dashboard card** with the node load and the guests, one click from the page.
- **Tags for the DCS VMs.** Every VM the hub builds carries `dcs` and its stack (`dcs;media-services`), the baked
  templates `dcs;template`, and the VM that runs the hub itself gets `dcs;hub` — put on by the wizard when it
  finishes with Proxmox linked, and by an **Add …** button naming the missing tags on the *This server* card of the Proxmox page whenever
  they are missing. Tags already on the VM stay; DCS only adds. The API token needs `VM.Config.Options` on that VM
  for it (the roles of *Building the VMs* have it; a token with only `VM.Audit`, `VM.PowerMgmt` and `Sys.Audit` is
  told so and the tags can be added in Proxmox by hand). A DCS that is not a hub gets `dcs` alone; a machine that is
  no guest of the linked Proxmox host is left as it is. DCS finds its own VM by the SMBIOS id, then a shared
  address (guest agent), then the name — the same way the hub matches its members.

### Events, alerts and audit

Every action is audited as `proxmox_vm_<action>` (`Started VM 101 (media-services) on pve by
scott`) and reaches your Integrations webhooks and Discord like any other event. A watcher in
the metrics loop checks the guests once a minute:

| Event | When |
|-------|------|
| `proxmox_vm_stopped` | a guest went from running to stopped, paused or unknown and DCS did not ask for it in the last five minutes |
| `proxmox_vm_started` | a guest came back to running without DCS asking |
| `proxmox_vm_start`, `_shutdown`, `_stop`, `_reboot`, `_reset`, `_suspend`, `_resume` | DCS did it (dashboard, API or bot) |

Add them to a webhook on the Notifications page (group **Proxmox**) or make a notification rule
with the *VM stopped on its own* trigger for ntfy or Discord.

### The Discord bot

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/vms` | Every node and guest: state, CPU, memory, uptime, grouped by node |
| `/vm <name or VMID> <action>` | `info`, or `start`, `shutdown`, `stop`, `reboot`, `reset`, `suspend`, `resume` — admins only, with a confirmation for anything but start and resume |
| `/fleet` | The hub's members: which VM each DCS runs in, its stacks, whether it answers (on a member: the hub it belongs to) |

The bot's DCS account may power guests when it has the **bot** or **admin** role.

### The API

| Method | Path | Access |
|--------|------|--------|
| GET | `/proxmox/status` | user — configured, reachable, version, node and guest counts, hints |
| GET | `/proxmox/nodes` | user |
| GET | `/proxmox/vms` | user — every guest (templates dropped) |
| GET | `/proxmox/vms/{node}/{qemu\|lxc}/{vmid}` | user — live status plus configuration |
| GET | `/proxmox/self` | user — the guest this DCS runs in (found by SMBIOS id, address or name), the tags it has and the ones it should have |
| POST | `/proxmox/self/tag` | admin — give that guest its tags now (`dcs`, and `hub` on a hub); needs `VM.Config.Options` on it |
| GET | `/proxmox/tasks` | user — recent tasks |
| POST | `/proxmox/vms/{node}/{qemu\|lxc}/{vmid}/{action}` | admin, bot — `start shutdown stop reboot reset suspend resume` |
| POST | `/proxmox/test` | admin — try `{url, token_id, token_secret, verify_tls}` without saving |

Read endpoints are cached for 10–15 s like the rest of the dashboard's polls; a power action
clears the cache.

---

## 4. A Traefik in another VM or machine (the route feed)

In the hub-and-VMs layout on one Proxmox box, the Traefik in the networking VM is "another
machine" from the media VM's point of view: it must reach containers that live in other VMs.
The same is true of a friend's proxy box. In both cases DCS does not need its own Traefik. Every route DCS makes (deploys, the DNS & Routes
page) is published as a **feed** that Traefik's HTTP provider pulls; nothing is installed on the
proxy machine, and a new deployment shows up there within seconds.

1. **Config → Traefik & DNS → Traefik on another machine**: switch *Publish routes as a
   feed* on and save. DCS mints a token.
2. Set the **target host** if the proxy should reach this machine at another address than its
   LAN IP (a Tailscale IP, for instance), the **entrypoint** name that Traefik uses
   (`websecure` by default), any **middlewares** that exist over there, and whether the routes
   carry **TLS** with a named **certificate resolver**.
3. Copy the **snippet** the panel shows into that Traefik's static configuration and restart it:

   ```yaml
   providers:
     http:
       endpoint: "http://192.168.1.20:9876/traefik/dynamic?token=…"
       pollInterval: "10s"
   ```

   Through the dashboard instead of the API port: `https://<dashboard>/api/traefik/dynamic?token=…`.
   Traefik v3 can send the token as a header instead of a query string:
   `headers: { Authorization: "Bearer …" }`.
4. The panel shows **Last pulled … by …** once the proxy has fetched the feed, how many routes
   it serves and which it could not offer.

What the feed does with a route: the rule stays (`Host(`plex.example.com`)`), the service URL
`http://Plex:32400` becomes `http://<target host>:<published host port>`, middlewares are
replaced by the list you configured (the local ones do not exist over there), and TLS is added.
A container that publishes no host port, or only on `127.0.0.1`, cannot be reached by another
machine and is listed as skipped.

A host with no Traefik of its own keeps its route files in `.data/routes`, so deploys still
create routes (and Cloudflare DNS records) for the feed. A local Traefik and the feed can be on
at the same time. `POST /traefik/feed/token` (the *Rotate* button) mints a new token; the old
one stops working at once.

---

## 5. The fleet: the VM is the stack

Every stack you would have run in a directory on one Docker host runs in its own Proxmox VM
instead, and the hub — the DCS linked to Proxmox — makes that invisible:

- `media-services`, `networking-security`, `development-tools`… are **VMs named like the
  stack**, each with Docker and a DCS **node** that carries that one stack (`DOCKER_STACKS=
  media-services`). A node is the API alone (`DCS_ROLE=node` in its `.env`): no dashboard, no
  accounts of its own, no setup wizard, no first-admin gate — the hub's own account (`dcs-hub`),
  made by the join, is the only one on it, and a person who opens a node's address is sent to the
  hub's dashboard. The hub keeps `core-infrastructure` (the dashboard, the bot, ntfy, uptime).
- The hub's **API is the fleet API**: `GET /stacks` lists the members' stacks next to its own
  (each with `placement: "vm"`, the member and the VMID), and `/stacks/{name}/…`,
  `/containers/{name}/…` and a template deploy whose target stack lives in a VM are **forwarded
  to that VM's DCS** with your own role checked on the hub. The Stacks page shows a *VM* chip,
  the Containers page lists every VM's containers with a *VM* chip, the deploy dialog's stack
  list says which stacks are VMs, and the bot's `/stacks` and `/fleet` follow. Nothing is
  scheduled or moved between VMs: this is a control plane over independent compose hosts, and
  a VM that loses the hub keeps running its stack.
- **The VM is born as the stack, and the hub keeps its files**: when the hub builds the VM for
  `media-services`, its own `Stacks/media-services` folder (compose, `.env`, config files — never
  `App-Data`, data or backups) is copied into the VM and starts there; a row you renamed in the
  wizard keeps the folder it came from. From then on `Stacks/media-services/` on the hub is the
  stack's home: the dashboard reads and writes the hub's copy, every save is pushed into the VM
  right after (the answer says whether the VM took it), what the VM writes itself (a template
  deployed into it) is pulled back, and a VM the hub did not build — linked by address or by a
  join code — has its stacks adopted on the first read, on join and from the watcher, which also
  places a stack that nobody answered for with the VM that runs it. Only configuration travels:
  no `App-Data`, data, logs, caches, `acme.json` or edit backups, 2 MB a file, 16 MB a stack, and
  a path cannot leave the stack folder. A VM that is off still shows its files; a rebuilt VM gets
  its stack back with *Push files to the VM* (`POST /stacks/{name}/push`), *Pull files from the
  VM* takes what the VM has (`/pull`), and *Sync stack files* on the VM does every stack of it
  (`POST /fleet/members/{id}/sync`, `{direction: "push"}` the other way). A stack with no folder
  starts empty and takes templates.
- **A VM's App-Data, live on the hub**: what a stack's containers write stays in its VM and is
  never copied — and the hub shows it. `Stacks/<name>/VM-App-Data` on the hub is the VM's own
  `Stacks/<name>/App-Data`, mounted over the hub's ssh key (sshfs): open a config file there,
  save it, and it is saved in the VM. The far side serves as root when the VM's account has
  passwordless sudo (a VM the hub built has), because an App-Data belongs to whatever user each
  container runs as; a file edited in place keeps its owner, a file *made* from the hub belongs
  to root in the VM. The mount comes by itself — after a deploy or a start in the VM, and from the
  hub's watcher every minute for whatever is not mounted (a VM that was off, a hub that
  restarted). While nothing is mounted the link shows one file, `NOT-MOUNTED.txt`, with the
  reason; the stack's page says the same and has **Mount** and **Unmount**
  (`GET /stacks/{name}/appdata`, `POST /stacks/{name}/appdata/mount`, `…/unmount` keeps it down
  until Mount). It needs `sshfs` on the hub — installed by itself when the DCS account has
  passwordless sudo (a hub image has), otherwise `sudo apt install sshfs` or
  `sudo dnf install fuse-sshfs` — and the hub's key in the VM's account (see *VMs you made
  yourself*). The link has a name of its own and points at a mount *outside* the DCS folder
  (`~/.dcs-vm-data/<name>`, `FLEET_MOUNT_DIR`) on purpose: whatever on the hub copies, archives
  or removes a stack folder — a deleted stack, a backup, a recovery bundle, removing DCS — meets
  a link and never the VM's data behind it, and what the hub does with `App-Data` folders (its
  Traefik's routes, Homarr's database, a factory reset) keeps meaning the stacks it runs itself.
  `FLEET_APPDATA_MOUNT=false` switches it off.
- **The Stacks page is the VMs page** on a hub: the sidebar reads *VMs*, the VMs come first (each
  one a stack) and the hub's own stacks follow; open a VM for the containers running in it, with
  start/stop/restart per container, the compose editor, logs, and the VM's own power. *New VM*
  builds one more, and the builds show on the same page. The Proxmox page's VM cards list the
  same containers with *Open* and *Edit compose*.
- **Proxmox and DCS agree**: starting or stopping a VM in the Proxmox UI is the stack going up
  or down (the VM starts at boot and DCS's boot services start the stack); the Proxmox page
  shows each VM with its stack, containers and power buttons.

### Building the VMs

The wizard's **Stacks** step, once Proxmox is linked and the token may create VMs, shows a
*Hub / VM* switch per stack (VM for every stack but `core-infrastructure`), cores, RAM and disk
per VM, and a **VM settings** panel prefilled from Proxmox and the hub's network: node, disk
storage, image storage, bridge, the first address to hand out, the prefix, gateway and DNS.
*Complete setup* creates the hub's own stacks, then hands the VM plan to the hub, which builds
the VMs one after another in the background. The success screen and the Proxmox page follow
each build on a **progress card**; later, **New VM stack** on the Proxmox page builds one more.

Each build job walks these steps (idempotent, so *Retry* on a failed job resumes where it
stopped):

| Step | What the hub does |
|------|-------------------|
| **Image** | Switches the *import* content type on the image storage if needed, then asks Proxmox to download the Debian cloud image (`FLEET_IMAGE_URL`) into it once. A token without `Sys.AccessNetwork` cannot make Proxmox download, so the hub downloads the image itself and uploads it. |
| **Create** | `POST /nodes/{node}/qemu` with the next free VMID: the image imported as the boot disk (`import-from`), a cloud-init drive, virtio network on the bridge, the guest agent enabled, `onboot`, tags `dcs;<stack>`, then the disk grown to the size you chose. |
| **Cloud-init** | User `dcs` (`FLEET_VM_USER`) with the hub's own ssh key (made once in `.data/fleet-ssh`), the static address, gateway and DNS. |
| **Boot** | Starts the VM and waits for the Proxmox task. |
| **SSH** | Waits for the VM to answer ssh (first boot runs cloud-init). |
| **Install** | Copies `.scripts/fleet-bootstrap.sh` to the VM and runs it: a network check, curl/git/jq/socat/openssl/python3 and the QEMU guest agent, Docker (get.docker.com, with fallbacks) and Compose, then the hub's **own code** as a bundle (`GET /fleet/bundle?token=<join code>`, never data, accounts, secrets or stacks), then an **unattended node setup** (`DCS_ROLE=node`: no admin account is made — the join creates the hub's account, the only one the VM needs), which writes the configuration, creates the stack, starts the API without a dashboard and joins the hub, and finally the boot services (`dcs-api`, `dcs-stacks`). Every line lands in the job log. |
| **Join** | Waits for the VM's join, then maps the member to the VMID and marks it *provisioned*. |
| **Stack** | Copies the hub's `Stacks/<source>` (default: the stack's own name) into the VM over ssh — compose, `.env` and config files, never `App-Data`, data, backups or logs — and starts it through the member's API. Nothing to copy: the VM starts empty. |
| **Ready** | Asks the member for its stacks through the hub. |

What Proxmox needs from the token, beyond `VM.Audit`, `VM.PowerMgmt` and `Sys.Audit`: the
roles **PVEVMAdmin**, **PVEDatastoreAdmin** and **PVESDNUser** on `/` (Datacenter →
Permissions → Add), or the privileges `VM.Allocate`, `VM.Config.*`, `Datastore.AllocateSpace`,
`Datastore.AllocateTemplate`, `Datastore.Allocate` (to switch *import* on) and `SDN.Use`.
`Sys.AccessNetwork` on the node (a custom role) lets Proxmox download the image itself.
To share a folder of the host with a VM from the dashboard (*Host folders*), the role
**PVEMappingAdmin** on `/mapping/dir`.
`GET /proxmox/capabilities` and the wizard say what is missing. The hub itself needs `ssh` and
`ssh-keygen`, a dir storage for the image (`local`), a bridge the VMs share with the hub, a
free address range, and internet from the VMs (the install log says at once when there is
none).

### The operating system

Every VM is built from an image that needs no hand on it. The default is a **purpose-built DCS
image** (Debian 13, Ubuntu 26.04, Fedora 44 or Arch Linux as a Docker host and nothing else, see
[VM images](VM-IMAGES.md)); the others are **cloud images**, systems that take their user, key,
address, Docker and DCS from cloud-init and the bootstrap. The VM settings (the wizard's Stacks
step, *New VM*) offer:

| Choice | What happens |
|--------|--------------|
| **DCS images** — DCS Debian 13 (the default), DCS Ubuntu 26.04, DCS Fedora 44, DCS Arch Linux | Proxmox downloads the node image once from the release of this DCS version (the hub has it check the download against the release's `SHA256SUMS`; `FLEET_DCS_IMAGE_BASE` names another place). Every VM is created from it as it is: the tools, Docker and the guest agent are in place, so there is nothing to install and nothing to bake; only the fresh DCS code and the join run. |
| **Cloud images** — Debian 13, Debian 12, Ubuntu Server 26.04 / 24.04 / 22.04 LTS, Fedora Cloud, AlmaLinux 9 | Proxmox downloads the image once into the import storage (or the hub fetches and uploads it), every VM built from it imports that file. |
| **On Proxmox already** — a cloud image in the import storage | Used as is: put images there yourself (Datacenter → Storage → *local* → *Import*) and they show up. |
| **On Proxmox already** — an installer ISO from *ISO Images* | The hub creates the VM with the ISO attached and stops there: install the system in the VM's Proxmox console (the card says which address to give it), then run the one-line join the card shows. The build closes by itself when the VM joins. Anything Proxmox can boot works this way. |
| **A URL** | Any cloud image (`.qcow2`, `.img`, `.raw`) with cloud-init and apt or dnf inside. |

Debian and Ubuntu (apt) and Fedora and AlmaLinux (dnf) are covered by the bootstrap (Arch has its own image, it needs none); on
dnf systems it opens the API port in firewalld and leaves SELinux enforcing (add `:z` to a
volume Docker must write). A `.config/fleet-images.json` on the hub (an array of
`{id, label, url, file, family}`) replaces the catalogue. The choice applies to every VM of a
build; *New VM* can pick a different one per VM.

### Faster builds: the baked DCS template

(A purpose-built DCS image is already what a bake makes, so it is never baked.)

A build from a cloud image spends most of its minute and a half installing packages and Docker. Tick
**Bake a DCS template first** in the VM settings (on by default) and the hub does that work
once: it builds one VM from the chosen image, installs the tools, Docker and the guest agent,
seals it (`cloud-init clean`, a fresh machine id and host keys) and turns it into a Proxmox
**template** tagged `dcs;template`. Every VM for that image is then a **full clone** of the
template plus its own cloud-init: the build takes about half a minute and only the fresh DCS code
from the hub, the setup and the join run inside. The picker lists baked templates first; a
template stays for the next builds, and one bake serves the wizard's whole layout. `GET
/fleet/templates` lists them, `POST /fleet/templates` bakes one by hand, `DELETE
/fleet/templates/{vmid}` removes one (with its VM) — bake again after a big OS update.

### Keeping the VMs on the hub's version

The hub's code is the fleet's code. On a hub, the Updates page shows **The VMs** under the DCS
Framework card: every member with the DCS version it answers with (asked live, `GET
/fleet/versions`), amber when it differs from the hub's. **Update all VMs** (`POST /fleet/update
{members: "all"}`, or a list of ids) hands each answering member the hub's own code: the member
downloads the hub's bundle with a one-hour join code minted for the round (`POST
/fleet/self-update {bundle_url}` on the member, admin only), saves the code it had as
`.snapshots/dcs-code-<version>-<time>.tar.gz`, unpacks the bundle over its install — its `.env`,
`.data`, accounts, secrets, stacks, logs and the settings files it already has in `.config` are
untouched — writes an entry to its update history and restarts its API in place (the same
`kill -USR1` re-exec the hub's own updates use, under systemd or not). The answer lists what
happened per member and the last round stays on the card. A hub update with **Then update the
VMs** ticked (the default on a hub with members: `POST /system/update/apply {fleet: true}`)
queues a round that the hub runs by itself once its API is back on the new code. When the
installer changed with the code (the systemd unit comes from it), a member runs it again and
restarts through systemd instead, so the unit follows too. Every card carries the same status
line: up to date or not, when it was checked, when it last changed.

Image updates see the whole fleet: the Updates page of a hub opens on **Everywhere** — every
image on the hub and on each VM in one list (`GET /fleet/images`), each row saying where it
runs, with *Check Registry* asking every DCS at once (`POST /fleet/images/check`) and each pull
going to the DCS the row belongs to. The **Images on** row narrows the list to the hub alone or
to one VM (the member proxy carries the calls, so nothing new is exposed). Without Proxmox
nothing changes: a DCS without members shows neither the card nor the row, and a VM's own
Updates page says *Updated by its hub* instead of looking for releases.

### Everything from the hub

The hub is the one place to look at and to run the whole server. Every page that lists things
opens on **Everywhere** on a hub — the hub and every VM in one list, each row carrying a capsule
that says where it lives (*Hub*, or *VM #103 · media-services*) — and the same row of chips
narrows it to the hub alone or to one VM: Health, Images, Updates, Networks, Volumes, Backups,
Automation, Secrets and Activity all share the one choice, and it
is remembered. *Everywhere* is a view: to change something, pick the hub or the VM it lives on
(clicking a row's capsule does that), and the change happens on that DCS through the hub. The API
is the same: `?fleet=1` on `GET /health`, `/images`, `/networks`, `/volumes`, `/events`,
`/snapshots`, `/automations`, `/schedules`, `/secrets` and `/audit` merges every member's rows
(tagged `member`, `member_name`, `vmid`) with the hub's, and `members[]` says how each DCS did.

Some things go further than a merged list:

- **Routes to the VMs.** The hub's own Traefik reaches every service inside the VMs without any
  configuration: the hub writes the members' routes (each VM's DCS writes one per deployed
  service, `service.your.domain`) into its Traefik's `custom_routes` directory as
  `fleet-members.yml`, which the file provider watches, and keeps that file current every half
  minute — with the hub's own middleware chain on every router, so a service in a VM is served,
  compressed, guarded by CrowdSec and put behind Authelia exactly like one on the hub (templates
  whose apps bring their own clients stay open; see the README). A new route also gets its
  Cloudflare record and its Homarr tile from the hub when those are set up there - Homarr on the hub
  or in any VM of the fleet (store its API key on the hub's Integrations page). When the
  Traefik lives inside a VM instead, the hub pushes everyone else's routes into that VM's
  Traefik (`POST /fleet/routes`). A Traefik somewhere else keeps using the feed (section 4).
- **Apps reach each other by name.** The hub knows every running container with a published
  port, on the hub and in every VM, as a service with a LAN address and a route (`GET
  /fleet/services`). When you deploy a template whose `*_URL` or `*_HOST` variable was left at its
  compose-network default — `http://jellyfin:8096` reaches a Jellyfin on the same Docker network
  only — the hub points it at the fleet's service of that name wherever it runs (on the hub, or
  before the deploy is forwarded into a VM); a value you typed is kept, and the Activity page says
  what was filled.
- **One domain.** The fleet's domain is the hub's (`TRAEFIK_DOMAIN` or `PROXY_DOMAIN`): a VM the
  hub builds gets it at build time, a server that joins gets it with the join answer, and older
  members get it from the hub within a minute (`POST /fleet/hub/domain`, written as
  `PROXY_DOMAIN`); a member that has a domain of its own keeps it. When the domain arrives, the
  VM writes the routes for the services it already runs (`POST /traefik/routes/rebuild` does
  the same by hand, on any DCS that got Traefik after its stacks).
- **Every page, every VM.** *Everywhere* on the Topology page is the fleet map: the hub's stacks and
  containers and every reachable VM's, each under its server's band. Containers, Logs, Topology, File Browser,
  Environment, System and Cleanup take the same Everywhere / Hub / VM choice as the list
  pages: a container's buttons (start, stop, restart, recreate, remove, env, exec, logs, Sablier,
  Nuke & reinstall) act on the VM it lives in, a stack's backup runs on its VM and restores go to
  the archive's own server, a VM's files and `.env` open through the hub, OS updates on a VM the
  hub built need no password, and maintenance numbers add up (the hub answers the Cleanup
  page's three questions for the whole fleet in one call each: `GET /maintenance/report`,
  `/orphans`, `/disk` with `?fleet=1`). Activity's Live stream tab follows the same choice
  (`GET /stream?fleet=1` / `?member=`). The hub only forwards a container request to the
  member whose recorded placements include the container's stack.
- **A shell in every VM.** The Terminal page has the Hub / VM chips: unlock it once with the
  hub's Linux credentials and a VM the hub built is a click away — the command runs inside the
  VM as its DCS account over the hub's ssh key (`GET /fleet/members/{id}/terminal` says whether
  the hub can, `POST /fleet/members/{id}/terminal/exec` runs it), with the same command guard,
  rate limit, 60 s limit and audit log as the hub's own terminal; the prompt says where each
  command ran. From your own computer the hub is the jump host (`ssh -J you@hub dcs@<vm address>`),
  once the VM holds your public key — a VM the hub builds holds the hub's key only; on the hub,
  `cat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys | ssh -i ~/.Docker-Compose-Skeleton-AIO/.data/fleet-ssh/id_ed25519 -o StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new dcs@<vm address> 'cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'`
  gives a VM the keys the hub accepts. A VM you made yourself needs the hub's public key
  (`.data/fleet-ssh/id_ed25519.pub`) in its DCS account's `authorized_keys` first.
- **Homarr and themes for a VM's apps.** A VM's container page offers **Add to Homarr** (the
  hub's Homarr gets the app at the host the hub's Traefik serves it on) and, for the apps
  theme.park themes, **Theme** — the hub keeps the choice and adds the theme.park middleware to
  that VM route when it writes `fleet-members.yml`. Start on demand stays with the hub's own
  containers: Sablier cannot wake a container inside a VM from the hub.
- **Themes and Homarr.** Themes (Settings → Appearance) live on the hub and every dashboard
  follows the one set for everyone; Homarr on the hub gets a tile for every routed app, the
  VMs' included, once its API key is stored (Config → Integrations, or
  `POST /homarr/key`), and *Sync routes* fills in what is missing.
- **The engine under the containers.** The Updates page's *Docker Engine* card shows the engine
  on the hub and in every VM — version, package source, the newest version that source offers —
  and updates them (`GET /system/docker-engine?fleet=1`, `POST /fleet/docker-engine/update`);
  a VM the hub built needs no password for it.

- **Events reach the hub.** A VM's DCS sends every event it raises (a container that stopped, a
  stack that started, an update, a failed backup…) to its hub with a relay token the hub handed
  it when it joined (`POST /fleet/relay`). The hub notes it on the Activity page as
  `fleet_event` and fires its own notification rules with the VM named — a Discord embed or an
  NTFY push from the hub reads *VM media-services · Container stopped* and carries the VM as a
  field, with the VM as the host it happened on. The VMs need no Discord or NTFY settings of their
  own; the hub's rules and channels cover the whole server. Members that joined before this get a
  token from the hub within a minute.
  Every DCS checks its containers once a minute by itself (not only while a dashboard is open), so a
  container that stops in a VM reaches the hub within about a minute. A VM sends each failure once:
  a container that is fine again is forgotten, and its next failure goes at once. A VM also sends its
  disk, processor and memory warnings and stale images (its own thresholds), and the hub's rules
  decide. The first five minutes after a boot are quiet (the stacks are still starting). A VM that
  DCS shuts down or starts is not announced as lost or back; one whose VM stopped by itself is
  announced once by Proxmox's own event.
- **A snapshot of everything.** *Create snapshot* on Everywhere (`POST /snapshots/create?fleet=1`)
  takes one snapshot on the hub and one on every VM at the same moment; each DCS keeps its own
  archive (a VM's files stay in the VM), the list shows them together, and a restore goes to the
  DCS the snapshot came from.
- **Secrets travel with a stack.** When a build moves a stack into its VM, the secrets the stack
  refers to (`${SECRETS_…}` in its compose or `.env`) are stored in the VM's own secret store
  first, so the stack starts there as it did on the hub.
- **One version everywhere.** The Updates page keeps every VM on the hub's DCS version (above).

Without Proxmox and without members nothing of this shows: the pages are as they were, and a
DCS with no fleet never asks anyone else.

### Moving a stack of the hub into a VM, with its data

A stack that already runs on the hub, with months of data, can move into a VM of its own without
starting over. On the Stacks page every stack *on the hub* has a **To a VM** button; the sheet it
opens says what goes with it, and *Move it* does the whole thing:

1. The VM is built and joins the hub while the stack keeps running on the hub.
   Before anything is stopped, the hub checks that the VM has what the stack needs outside its own folder (the
   folders at the same paths, the devices) and enough cores for its `cpus:` limits; when it does not, the job
   says what is missing and the stack keeps running on the hub.
2. The stack is stopped on the hub (not removed), so its data is at rest.
3. Its configuration goes over, then its folders (`App-Data`, `data`) and its named volumes, with every
   owner and permission as it is - a database's files stay the database's. Every copy is counted on both
   sides; a count that differs stops the move.
4. Its route files travel with it, so the same addresses reach it in the VM (the hub's own route files
   for it are set aside in `.data/moved-routes/`, never deleted).
5. It starts in the VM, and the move waits until as many containers are up there as ran on the hub, then
   watches them for a minute: a container that restarts in a loop, exits or reports unhealthy is not a move
   either. Only then the hub lets go: the stack leaves `DOCKER_STACKS`, the hub's containers of it are removed.
   When the VM's start fails, the job carries Docker's own error line (an image it cannot pull, a port that is
   taken, a limit above the VM's cores) and stops waiting at once.

**Nothing is lost.** The hub's copy of the data stays where it was, as the copy to fall back on; remove it
yourself once you trust the VM. If anything fails before the stack runs in the VM - the copy stops
part-way, the VM cannot pull an image, a port is taken there - the stack is started on the hub again and
the job says why. *Retry* picks the move up where it stopped (the VM it built is reused).

Verified in the lab with Sonarr: after the move the same API key opened the same database (a tag made on the
hub was there), a named volume kept its first-start timestamp, and every file kept owner `1000:1000`.

**Stacks that stay on the hub.** `core-infrastructure` and `networking-security` carry the hub itself (its
proxy, sign-in and firewall): they have no *To a VM* button and the API refuses to move them
(`FLEET_HUB_ONLY_STACKS` lists them). A stack with Nextcloud All-in-One is refused too - it creates its own
containers and volumes outside the stack, which would not travel.

**Cores.** Docker refuses a container whose `cpus:` limit is above the machine's cores (*range of CPUs is from
0.01 to 2.00*), and Compose then starts none of the stack. The sheet sets the VM's cores to the largest limit
and memory to the stack's memory limits plus 1 GB; a request with fewer cores is refused with the service named.

**Start on demand.** Containers that start on demand on the hub keep doing so in the VM: the VM gets its own Sablier
(see [Start on demand in a VM](#start-on-demand-in-a-vm)), and once the move is done they are put to sleep there as they
were. The hub sets its own Sablier blocks for them aside (`.data/moved-routes/<stack>-…-sablier`).

**Good to know** (shown in the sheet, nothing stops the move): ports the stack publishes open on the VM's
address; services that use the Docker socket see the VM's containers; settings that reach other stacks by
container name (`http://sonarr:8989` in an app's config, found in its config files), and other stacks that
reach this one, need the new address afterwards.

What does not travel: **folders outside the stack**, such as a media library on another drive
(`/mnt/media:/media`). The sheet lists them; give the VM the same path first - a [folder of the Proxmox
host](#a-folder-of-the-proxmox-host-inside-a-vm-media-libraries) when the drive is on the Proxmox host, a
network share otherwise - or the containers start with empty folders there. Apps in *other* stacks that
reach this one by container name need its new address (`<the VM's address>:<port>`) afterwards.

How the hub reads folders of other users: with passwordless sudo when it has it, else through a small
read-only container (`alpine:3`, pulled once), else as its own user - and then a file it cannot read stops
the move before anything was stopped. The VM's disk must hold the data: the sheet suggests a size, and
the request is refused when the disk is too small.

API: `GET /fleet/provision/move-check?stack=NAME` (what would go with it: `movable`, `blockers`, `min_cores`,
`cpu_limits`, `memory_limits_mb`, `ports`, `devices`, `docker_socket`, `links_out`, `links_in`), and
`{"move": true}` on a VM of `POST /fleet/provision`.

### Storage across every machine

With Proxmox linked, the **Disk Analysis** page shows all storage, not only this server's: one bar with a segment per
machine, this server's drives, and a card per Proxmox node with its physical disks (model, NVMe/SSD/HDD, size, SMART
health, the life left on an SSD, what the disk is used for), its storage pools (LVM-thin, directory, ZFS, NFS…, used
of total) and its ZFS pools (health, fragmentation). The VMs of the fleet follow with their own disks.

The totals count real capacity once: this server's drives and the Proxmox pools. A VM's disk lives in a pool, so it is
shown but not added again; a storage every node shares (NFS, Ceph) counts once; and when this server is itself a guest of
the linked Proxmox (recognised the way the hub's own VM is tagged), its drives are inside a node's pools and are left out
of the total, which the page says. Listing the disks needs `Sys.Audit` on the node (the roles above have it), the pools
`Datastore.Audit`. API: `GET /storage/overview` (sizes in bytes); `GET /disks` now also answers `fstype`, `total_bytes`,
`used_bytes` and `avail_bytes`.

### Start on demand in a VM

A container in a VM can start on demand like one on the hub: the first visit wakes it, and it goes back to sleep after
its idle time. *Start on demand* on the container's sheet (or the deploy sheet's switch, for a stack placed in a VM) works
the same for both.

The hub's Traefik serves the VM's routes, but the hub's Sablier cannot reach the VM's Docker. So the VM runs a Sablier of
its own (container `Sablier`, made by DCS the first time one of its containers starts on demand), the VM tells the hub
which of its routes start on demand (`GET /fleet/feed` → `dcs_on_demand`, `dcs_sablier_port`), and the hub puts a Sablier
step on those routes that asks the VM's Sablier (`sablierUrl: http://<the VM>:10000`, last in the router's list, after
sign-in). A sleeping container's route stays served: the hub reads its port from the container's own settings.

**Only the hub can reach it.** Sablier has no login: whoever reaches it can start any container of the VM, and through a
short session stop one. Its port answers the hub's address alone: a firewall rule in Docker's `DOCKER-USER` chain (marked
`dcs-sablier`) drops every other source, and it fails closed. Without that rule Sablier is not started, one that runs is
stopped, and after a reboot it starts only once the rule is back (it has no restart policy; DCS starts it a second after
its API is up). The rule follows the hub's address when that changes. The VM needs `iptables` and sudo for the `dcs`
user, which the DCS images have. `FLEET_SABLIER_PORT` (10000) is the port.

Sablier stops a container only when a session for it ends, and a visit starts one. A container that starts on demand
but was started some other way (the boot, *Start*, an image update, a move) is announced to Sablier once per start with
its own idle time, on the hub and in every VM, so it falls asleep unless it is used. An app open in a browser tab stays
awake: its page keeps asking the app, and that is use.

Verified in the lab: the VM's Sablier answers the hub (200) and nothing else (the Proxmox host: no answer); a Sonarr in
the VM slept after its idle minute, woke on the next request, slept again; after a reboot the rule was back before Sablier.

### Two machines: the hub here, Proxmox there

The hub does not have to run on the Proxmox host. A Docker server on one machine (the hub, say
`192.168.2.11`) linked to a Proxmox on another (`192.168.2.50`) builds its VMs over there, joins them, and
routes to them through its own Traefik exactly as if they were local - this is the layout the fleet was
tested on. The hub's own stacks stay on the hub; *To a VM* moves the ones you want over. Give the VMs
addresses on the same network as the hub (the `ip_start` of the VM settings).

### A folder of the Proxmox host inside a VM (media libraries)

A VM's disk is for the system and the apps' own data. A media library that already sits on the
Proxmox host — a ZFS dataset, a directory on a second drive — is shared into the VM instead of being
copied onto its disk: Proxmox VE 8.4 and later hand a host folder to a VM with **virtiofs**, and
the DCS images mount it as they are (their kernel has virtiofs; the Debian image's kernel has no
USB-storage driver, so a USB drive is plugged into the host and shared the same way).

**From the dashboard.** On the Proxmox page, a VM's card has a **Host folders** button (the
folder with an arrow). The sheet lists the folders the VM has — the folder on the host, where the
VM mounts it, the containers that use it — and **Share a folder of the host** does every step
below for you:

1. A name (`media`) and the folder on the Proxmox host (`/tank/media`; the host's storages are
   offered as starting points), or a mapping Proxmox already has. Where the VM mounts it
   (default `/mnt/<name>`), read-only or not.
2. **Share and restart the VM**: the hub makes the mapping on Proxmox, adds the virtiofs device to
   the VM, writes the line into the VM's `/etc/fstab`, has Proxmox stop and start the VM (a new
   device only appears then — its containers are down for about a minute), mounts the folder and
   restarts the stacks that already name it. The sheet shows each step as it happens. With the
   restart box off, nothing stops: the folder mounts by itself the next time the VM is shut down
   and started.
3. **Use in a container**: pick the stack and the service, the path inside the container
   (`/media`), optionally a subfolder (`Movies`) and read-only. The hub adds that one volume line
   to the stack's compose file — saved like any edit in the compose editor, the version before
   kept — and starts the stack again. A stack that already binds the folder (Jellyfin's *Media
   path* set to `/mnt/media`) needs nothing: it is listed under the folder at once.

**Remove** takes the folder from the VM (unmounted, out of its fstab, the device off the VM;
optionally the mapping off Proxmox). Nothing is ever deleted on the host.

The token needs one more role for this, **PVEMappingAdmin on `/mapping/dir`** (the sheet says so
and shows the command when it is missing):

```bash
pveum acl modify /mapping/dir --users dcs@pve --roles PVEMappingAdmin
```

The folder must exist on the Proxmox host. A ZFS dataset is already a folder (`zfs list` shows
its mountpoint, like `/tank/media`). A plain drive is mounted on the host first:

```bash
lsblk -f                                   # find the partition and its UUID
mkdir -p /mnt/media
echo 'UUID=<the uuid> /mnt/media ext4 defaults,nofail 0 2' >> /etc/fstab
systemctl daemon-reload && mount /mnt/media
```

**By hand**, the same three steps:

1. **On Proxmox.** *Datacenter → Directory Mappings → Add*: a name (`media`), the node, the folder
   on the host. Then the VM → *Hardware → Add → Virtiofs* with that mapping. The same from the
   host's shell:
   ```bash
   pvesh create /cluster/mapping/dir --id media --map node=pve,path=/tank/media
   qm set 105 --virtiofs0 dirid=media
   ```
   The share is there at the VM's next *start*: shut the VM down and start it (a reboot from
   inside the VM keeps the old hardware).
2. **In the VM** (the Terminal page with the VM chosen):
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /mnt/media
   echo 'media /mnt/media virtiofs defaults,nofail 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo mount /mnt/media
   ```
   The first word of the line is the mapping's name. The folder is mounted before Docker starts
   at every boot.
3. **In the stack.** The app's volume names the folder in the VM: the Jellyfin template's *Media
   path* (`MEDIA_PATH`) is mounted read-only at `/media` in the container; for a stack that
   already runs, add or change the volume in the compose editor (`- /mnt/media:/media:ro`), and
   restart the stack — a container that was started before the folder was mounted keeps seeing
   the empty folder until it is started again. The library in the app is then `/media/...`.

Files keep the owner and mode they have on the host, and the VM can write to the share unless the
volume says `:ro`. Several VMs can use one mapping. A VM with a virtiofs share cannot be
live-migrated or snapshotted with its RAM. Checked on Proxmox VE 9.2 with the DCS Debian 13 image.

### The whole thing, step by step

For a fresh Proxmox host, this is the entire path — no terminal on the VMs, no files to edit:

1. Make one VM for the hub (any Debian or Ubuntu, 2 cores, 4 GB, 20 GB) and install DCS in it
   with the one-line installer from the README. The setup wizard opens in the browser.
2. In the wizard's **Proxmox** step, paste the host's address and an API token (section 1 above
   shows the two clicks that make one) and press *Test*. Green means the hub can see the host.
3. In the **Stacks** step, every stack you ticked shows a *Hub / VM* switch. Leave them on *VM*:
   each becomes its own VM, named like the stack. Sizes and the operating system are prefilled;
   change them if you like.
4. Press **Complete setup**. The hub bakes a DCS template once, then clones a VM per stack; each
   card on the screen shows the build step by step. A VM takes about half a minute from a template.
5. When the cards are green, the dashboard opens: the Stacks page lists every VM as a stack, the
   Containers page every container with its VM, and the Updates, Health, Images and the other
   pages show *Everywhere*.
6. Later: *New stack → In its own VM* adds one more; *Update all VMs* on the Updates page keeps
   them current; Discord or NTFY on the hub's Notifications page covers every VM.

### Your own shell in a VM (ssh)

A VM the hub built has no password at all: it has the user `dcs` (`FLEET_VM_USER`), passwordless `sudo`, and one way in,
the hub's own key. That key was made once on the hub, in `~/.Docker-Compose-Skeleton-AIO/.data/fleet-ssh/id_ed25519`
(the public half sits beside it). It is what lets you in from your own computer too.

**1. Take the key to your computer** (once). From a machine that can already ssh to the hub:

```bash
scp howson@192.168.2.11:.Docker-Compose-Skeleton-AIO/.data/fleet-ssh/id_ed25519 ~/.ssh/dcs-fleet
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/dcs-fleet
```

**2. Name the VMs in `~/.ssh/config`.** The address of a VM is on the Proxmox page (and in `GET /fleet/members`).
One block per VM, named like its stack, so `ssh media-services` is all you type:

```
Host media-services
    HostName 192.168.2.202
    User dcs
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/dcs-fleet
    IdentitiesOnly yes
    IdentityAgent none
```

A VM on a network your computer cannot reach (the hub's lab, a second site) is reached *through the hub*:
give the hub a block of its own and name it as the jump host.

```
Host dcs-hub
    HostName hub.example.com
    User howson
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

Host media-services
    HostName 192.168.2.202
    User dcs
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/dcs-fleet
    IdentitiesOnly yes
    IdentityAgent none
    ProxyJump dcs-hub
```

`IdentitiesOnly yes` keeps ssh from offering every key in your agent first (a VM refuses after a few tries), and
`IdentityAgent none` keeps it from asking an agent at all. Then `ssh media-services`, `scp file media-services:`, and
`sudo` inside needs no password.

**Treat the key like a root key**: it opens every VM the hub built, as a user with `sudo`. Keep it out of backups of your
home folder that others read, and do not put it on a shared machine. To give another person a way in of their own, add
*their* public key to the VM instead of handing out this one:

```bash
# from the hub (it holds the key that is allowed in)
ssh -i ~/.Docker-Compose-Skeleton-AIO/.data/fleet-ssh/id_ed25519 dcs@192.168.2.202 'cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys' < their-key.pub
```

**The easy way: a key of your own, from the dashboard.** The Proxmox page has an **SSH** button (and one on every VM card).
Tick the VMs, name the key (`howson-laptop`), type your dashboard password again, and the hub makes a fresh key for *you*:
its public half goes onto the VMs you ticked, the private half is shown **once** and downloaded with a ready ssh config.
The hub keeps no copy of the private half; removing the key in the same sheet takes it off every VM at once, so a lost
laptop costs one click, and the hub's own key is never handed out.

1. **Download the key** and **the ssh config** (two buttons on the last screen).
2. Paste the two lines shown there into a terminal on your computer: they move both files into `~/.ssh` and put one
   `Include` line at the top of `~/.ssh/config`.
3. `ssh media-services`. Every VM is named like its stack, and the route goes through the hub (`ProxyJump dcs-hub`), so it
   works from anywhere you can reach the hub even when the VMs sit on a private network. Untick *Connect through the hub*
   for direct blocks, or tick *Let this key into the hub too* so one key serves the whole way.

The same from a script: `POST /ssh/keys` with `{"name","members","password","via","hub_host"}` (admin session, not an API
key), `GET /ssh/keys/<id>/config`, `DELETE /ssh/keys/<id>`; see the [API reference](API.md).

A VM you made yourself has its own users and keys: see below.

### Giving a VM more room (resize)

The VM's details (its name on the Proxmox page) have a **Size** panel: *Resize* adds disk in GB, and sets cores and memory.
A disk only grows. For a VM the hub manages, the filesystem inside grows at once over the hub's ssh key (growpart, or
sfdisk and partx from util-linux, then resize2fs, xfs_growfs or btrfs; an LVM root is left to you), so the stack keeps
running and sees the room immediately. Other guests grow theirs at the next boot. Cores and memory are written to the VM's
configuration and apply at the next reboot; tick *Reboot now* to apply them at once. A memory balloon keeps its share of
the new size. From a script: `POST /proxmox/vms/<node>/<qemu|lxc>/<vmid>/resize` with `{"disk_add_gb": 20, "cores": 4,
"memory_mb": 8192, "restart": false}` (any of them). The token needs `VM.Config.Disk`, `VM.Config.CPU` and
`VM.Config.Memory` (PVEVMAdmin has them).

### Taking a VM back when the hub lost its password

The hub logs in to each VM as the account `dcs-hub`, with a password kept in the secret store as `FLEET_MEMBER_<NAME>_PASSWORD`.
If that secret was deleted (the Secrets page lists it like any other), the hub says *holds no password for …*; a run of failed
logins from the hub's address makes the VM answer *rate-limiting logins*, and an update round then fails for that VM with
*see the fleet card*. **Relink** repairs both in one step: on the Proxmox page open the VM's menu (the three dots) and press
*Relink to the hub*; on the Updates page the failed VM's line has the same link.

What the hub does: it mints a one-hour join code, lifts its own lock-out on the VM, runs the VM's own `--join-hub` over its
ssh key, and stores the new password the VM made for `dcs-hub`. The VM's stacks, placement, guest and settings stay as they
were, and a VM running an older DCS works too (the join has been in every version with members). From a script:
`POST /fleet/members/<id>/relink` (an admin session). A VM linked by address, which the hub has no ssh key for, answers with
the one line to run on the VM itself:

```bash
cd ~/.Docker-Compose-Skeleton-AIO && DCS_MEMBER_URL=http://<vm>:9876 ./.scripts/api-server.sh --join-hub http://<hub>:9876 <join code> <name>
```

### VMs you made yourself

Any VM — one you installed from an ISO, a VM from before the hub, a machine that is not on
Proxmox at all — becomes a node of the fleet with **one line**, and the hub then treats it like
a built one. The hub's Proxmox page (*Join code*) shows a code, valid 24 h, and the line:

```bash
curl -fsSL 'http://<hub>:9876/fleet/bootstrap?token=<code>' | bash
```

Run it on the VM as a user with sudo (`sudo -v` first if sudo asks for a password, or as root).
It installs curl, git, jq, socat, openssl, python3 and the guest agent, Docker and Compose
(Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch; whatever is there already is kept), fetches the hub's own code
(`GET /fleet/bundle`), sets DCS up as a **node** (`DCS_ROLE=node`: the API alone, no admin
account, no wizard), joins the hub — the join creates the hub's `dcs-hub` account on the node
and hands it over once — and installs the boot services. The node carries one stack named like
the machine (`&stack=<name>` on the URL chooses another; a build's code names its VM's stack);
give it its placement on the hub when the hub has a `Stacks/` folder of that name.

| How | When | What happens |
|-----|------|--------------|
| **The one line** (node) | Any VM, fresh or installed, on Proxmox or not | Above. `GET /fleet/bootstrap?token=<code>` serves `.scripts/fleet-bootstrap.sh` with the join's values in front of it; the hub's Proxmox page and `POST /fleet/join-tokens` (`node_command`) show the line ready to paste. |
| **Scan and link** (hub) | The wizard's Proxmox section after *Test connection*, or *Link VMs* on the Proxmox page | The hub asks Proxmox for each running guest's addresses (QEMU guest agent, or the container's interfaces) and probes DCS's API port; every install it finds gets a *Link* button (an account of that DCS), the rest the join code. |
| **A join code** (an installed DCS) | A VM that already runs a full DCS | `./setup.sh --join http://<hub>:9876 <code>` on the VM, or *Join a DCS hub* in that VM's wizard or Proxmox page: the member creates the account `dcs-hub` for the hub and hands it over once, and keeps its own dashboard and accounts. |
| **By address** (hub) | Any time | *Add member* on the Proxmox page: address, an account that exists on that DCS, optionally the guest. |

`./setup.sh` asks which one a machine is on its first run — **standalone**, **hub** (link
Proxmox here) or **member** (hub address and join code) — and unattended installs answer with
`DCS_FLEET_ROLE=hub|member|standalone`, `DCS_HUB_URL` + `DCS_JOIN_TOKEN` (+ `DCS_MEMBER_NAME`)
and `DCS_PROXMOX_URL` + `DCS_PROXMOX_TOKEN_ID` + `DCS_PROXMOX_TOKEN_SECRET`. `DCS_ROLE=node`
makes the install a node (the one line sets it; a DCS node image says so in `/etc/dcs-role`):
no role question, no admin, and the join runs at once. A full DCS (`DCS_ROLE=hub`, the default)
that joins before it has an admin saves the join and runs it in its wizard, on the same progress
card, because the hub's account made earlier would close the first-admin window — which is why a
fresh VM joined that way, and never visited by its wizard, did not link; a node has no such wait.
A fully unattended install (what the hub runs inside a VM) takes `DCS_UNATTENDED=true`,
`DCS_STACKS`, `DCS_MEMBER_NAME`, `DCS_TZ`, `DCS_PUID`, `DCS_PGID`, `DCS_PROXY_DOMAIN`,
`DCS_CF_DNS_API_TOKEN`, `DCS_API_PORT`, `DCS_API_BIND` and `DCS_NO_UI=true` (API only);
`DCS_ADMIN_USER` + `DCS_ADMIN_PASSWORD` make the first admin of a full DCS without the wizard.

The hub matches a member to its guest by the VM's **SMBIOS uuid** (`smbios1` in its
configuration; root-only in the VM's sysfs, so the bootstrap keeps a copy in `.data/product_uuid`
for the API — do the same on a VM you set up by hand), then a **shared address** (guest agent / container interfaces), then the
**name**; a member it could not place is listed under *Members without a guest* with *Pick the
guest*, and the member menu's *Test* re-matches.

### What the hub may do, and how it is kept safe

- The hub's account on a member is an **admin** (`dcs-hub`, a random 40-character password kept
  in the hub's secret store as `FLEET_MEMBER_<ID>_PASSWORD`), a *service account* that keeps its
  session when someone else signs in on that member. On a **node** it is the only account there
  is: `POST /auth/setup`, invites, `POST /auth/users`, `POST /auth/register` and the wizard's
  endpoints answer 403 naming the hub, and `POST /auth/login` refuses every name but a service
  account's — a node's API, open on the LAN, offers nothing to sign in to but what the hub holds.
- Every call the dashboard makes on a member goes **through the hub**
  (`/fleet/members/{id}/api/…`, or transparently for stacks, containers and deploys) with the
  caller's own role checked against the inner path — a viewer reads, a bot does what bots may,
  an admin does everything. Streams, auth and setup are never forwarded. Non-GET calls are
  audited on the hub as `fleet_proxy`.
- **Join codes** live 24 h (48 h for a build), are rate-limited like logins, and can be revoked
  from the Proxmox page. The **code bundle** a VM fetches needs a valid join code and never
  carries `.env`, accounts, secrets, data, stacks or logs. An update round mints a *bundle code*
  per member instead (tagged with the member, revoked the moment that member's call returns): it
  opens the bundle for that member and can never join.
- **Removing**: *Remove from the fleet* forgets a member (its `dcs-hub` account is removed when
  it answers); *Stop and destroy the VM on Proxmox* also stops and deletes the VM with its
  disks after you type the stack's name. *Leave* on a member removes the hub's account there.
  A node removed either way is left with no account at all: only a new join (the one line, or
  `.scripts/api-server.sh --join-hub` on it) puts it under a hub again.
- **Whose stack is it**: the hub treats a stack as its own when it is in the hub's `DOCKER_STACKS`
  or has containers up. A `Stacks/<name>` folder alone does not count — the repository ships one
  per stack, and a stack placed in a VM leaves its folder behind on the hub — so the VM's stack is
  the one listed, forwarded and deployed to. To move a stack that runs on the hub into a VM, stop
  it and take it out of `DOCKER_STACKS` first (the wizard's Stacks step does that for you).
- **The hub never starts a VM's stack itself**: `start.sh` (and the boot service), *Start All*
  and the batch actions skip every stack that a member runs — its folder on the hub is a
  leftover — whatever `DOCKER_STACKS` says; the log line says so. Actions on such a stack go to
  the VM instead.
- **One name, one guest**: building a VM for a stack whose name already exists as a guest on
  Proxmox is refused — link that guest from the Proxmox page (*Link VMs*) or rename it there. A
  failed build's VM can go with its job (*Dismiss* asks; `DELETE /fleet/jobs/{id}?destroy=true`).
- The hub reaches members at `http://<address>:9876` and members reach the hub at
  `FLEET_SELF_URL` (detected: the hub's LAN address and API port; set it when the hub sits
  behind another address). `FLEET_SCAN_PORTS` changes the ports the scan probes,
  `FLEET_IMAGE_URL` the cloud image, `FLEET_VM_USER` the user cloud-init makes.

### What a member can and cannot do to its hub

A member is another machine, so the hub treats everything it sends as data:

- **Routes**: a member's feed is never merged as sent. Every router and service is rebuilt from a
  whitelist — a name of `[a-z0-9-]`, one `Host(…)` rule with an optional `PathPrefix`,
  `entryPoints`, `tls` with a `certResolver` at most, `middlewares`; `priority` and every other
  field are dropped. A service may point at the member's own address only (the address the hub
  reaches it by, or what that name resolves to). A route for one of the hub's own hostnames (its
  route files, `ui.` and `api.` under the proxy domain, `DASHBOARD_PUBLIC_URL`) is refused, and a
  hostname two members offer goes to the first in the fleet list — the other is renamed
  `<sub>-<member-id>.<domain>`. `GET /traefik/feed/status` lists what was refused or renamed and
  why (`member_skipped`).
- **Stacks**: a member cannot attract another stack's requests. The stacks the hub forwards to a
  member (`/stacks/<name>/…`, template deploys) are its *placements*, given by the build that moved
  the stack in or by an admin (`PUT /fleet/members/{id}` with `stacks`), and at join only for
  names the hub has no `Stacks/` folder for. What a member says it runs is shown (`GET
  /fleet/overview` → `stacks`, next to `placements`; the VM rows of `GET /stacks` carry `placed`)
  but never becomes a placement.
- **Events**: `POST /fleet/relay` takes 30 events a minute per member (429 beyond). The context a
  member sends cannot pose as the hub (`hostname`, `timestamp`, `event`, `vm`, `vmid`, `member`
  are the hub's own) and is cut to 120 characters in the activity line; a member sends the same
  event for the same thing once per its cooldown (`.data/relay-state.json` on the member). A relayed event is never relayed
  again, and a server refuses to join one of its own members as hub (or to take its own hub as a
  member), so two hubs cannot bounce events between them.
- **Answers**: the hub reads at most 8 MB from a member, gives up on a connection after 2 s, probes
  a member it knows to be down with a 3 s `/ping` before any login, and types every field of a
  merged answer before it is counted — a member answering `{"networks": "nope"}` leaves
  `/networks?fleet=1` a valid answer with the hub's own rows, and a malformed answer to an update
  counts as that member failing, never as the round ending.
- **Code**: the member fetches an update from its own record of the hub's address (the hub sends
  the bundle code alone), so a hub reached by name, over HTTPS or on another interface serves it
  too; the old code lands in `.snapshots/code/` (private, the newest three), out of the
  configuration snapshots' list.
- **Names**: a member's name is cleaned when it registers (control characters out, 64 characters at
  most) and is the one the hub uses in activity lines and notifications; ntfy header values never
  carry a line break.
- **The hub's loop**: the fleet work (the watcher, relay tokens, the domain, the routes) runs in
  the background under a lock, so a member that stalls never holds up the hub's own samples.

| POST | `/fleet/update` | admin — bring members to the hub's version `{members: ["id", …] or "all"}`: each fetches the hub's bundle and re-executes; the round runs on its own — 202 `{running: true}` when it outlasts 25 s, `GET /fleet/versions` (`last_round`) follows it |
| POST | `/fleet/self-update` | admin, on a member — install a code bundle over this install `{token}` (the hub's bundle code; the bundle is fetched from the member's own record of its hub) or `{bundle_url}` under the hub's address; data, accounts, secrets, stacks and settings stay, the old code lands in `.snapshots/code` (the newest three) |

| GET | `/backups?fleet=1` | as the plain endpoint — the members' rows merged in (`member`, `member_name`, `vmid`); `GET /containers` on a hub carries them always |
| GET | `/stream?fleet=1` / `?member=id` | user — the hub's SSE stream with every VM's docker events (or one VM's) |
| GET | `/maintenance/report`, `/maintenance/orphans`, `/maintenance/disk` with `?fleet=1` | user — the hub's and every VM's maintenance picture in one answer each: numbers and sizes added up, rows tagged, `members[]` per DCS (30 s cache) |
| GET / POST | `/containers/{name}/homarr?member=id`, `/containers/{name}/theme?member=id` | user to look, admin to change — a VM's container on the hub's Homarr; a theme.park theme on its route in the hub's Traefik (kept in `.data/fleet-themes.json`) |
| GET / POST | `/fleet/members/{id}/terminal`, `/fleet/members/{id}/terminal/exec` | admin — can the hub open a shell in this VM (its ssh key, a live test); run a command there `{terminal_token, command, cwd?}` with the hub's own Terminal session, guarded, rate-limited and audited like the host terminal |
| POST | `/fleet/hub/domain` | admin, on a member — the hub hands the member the fleet's proxy domain `{domain, force}`; kept when the member has one of its own |
| POST | `/fleet/routes` | admin, on a member that runs a Traefik — the hub hands it everyone else's routes for that Traefik (`fleet-members.yml`) |

| POST | `/proxmox/vms/{node}/qemu/{vmid}/balloon` | admin — give a VM a memory balloon (three quarters of its memory kept): Proxmox then shows the guest's real usage and can take idle memory back |
| GET / POST | `/proxmox/capabilities`, `/proxmox/storage` | admin — what the token may do, the storages |
| GET / POST / DELETE | `/fleet/join-tokens`, `/fleet/join-tokens/{token}` | admin — join codes, each with `node_command`: the one line that makes any VM a node of this hub |

| POST / DELETE | `/fleet/join-hub`, `/fleet/hub` | admin — join a hub, leave it |

Command line, on any DCS: `.scripts/api-server.sh --join-hub URL CODE [NAME]` (a node joins at
once; a full DCS without an admin yet saves the join for its wizard), `--join-token [HOURS]`
(prints the code and the one line), `--fleet-status`.

## 6. Recommended layout on Proxmox

- **The hub** in its own small LXC or VM (2 cores, 2 GB, Docker installed): it keeps the
  dashboard (`core-infrastructure`), the Proxmox link, the fleet, the Discord bot and the route
  feed. An LXC needs *nesting* on for Docker (`features: nesting=1`, unprivileged is fine). Not
  on the Proxmox host itself: Docker there sets the kernel's forwarding policy to drop, which
  breaks the bridges Proxmox routes through.
- **One VM per stack**, built by the hub from the wizard's Stacks step (`media-services`,
  `networking-security`, `development-tools`…): 2 cores, 4 GB and 32 GB by default, sized per
  stack, each an API-only DCS with that one stack, joined to the hub, started at boot. VMs
  isolate CPU, memory and disks, and Proxmox backs each one up with vzdump.
- **The proxy** (Traefik, Authelia, CrowdSec) in the `networking-security` VM, pulling the
  hub's feed, which carries every VM's routes.
- **Addresses**: a range next to the hub (the wizard proposes `.200` upwards on the hub's
  subnet) on the bridge the hub shares with the VMs; the hub reaches each VM at
  `http://<address>:9876`, the VMs reach the hub at `FLEET_SELF_URL`.
- **DCS's own backups** stay per VM (Backup page); the hub's `.env`, `.data` and secret store
  are tiny and are covered by the VM backup.

## 7. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause and fix |
|---------|---------------|
| *Proxmox rejected the API token* (401) | The token ID must be `user@realm!name`; the secret is the one shown when the token was made. Make a new token if it was lost. |
| *The API token lacks permission* (403) | Give `VM.Audit`, `VM.PowerMgmt`, `Sys.Audit` on `/` to the user (privilege separation off) or to the token itself. |
| *did not answer* | Wrong URL or port (the web UI's, `:8006`), a firewall in front of it, or certificate verification on with the self-signed certificate — switch it off, or install a real certificate on Proxmox. *HTTP 301* from a setup before 3.9.7: the address was `http://`; Proxmox wants `https://…:8006` (3.9.7 switches it by itself). |
| Deploying a template into a VM stack: *Protecting a route needs Authelia* (before 3.9.8) | The hub owns Authelia for the VMs' routes (its Traefik serves them), so the choice is kept on the hub and the VM gets a plain deploy. Update the hub to 3.9.8. *Start on demand* is not offered for a stack in a VM: Sablier runs on the hub and wakes the hub's containers only. |
| `Stacks/<name>/VM-App-Data` on the hub holds only `NOT-MOUNTED.txt` | The file says why: the VM is off or does not answer ssh (the mount comes back by itself when it does), the stack has made no App-Data yet (it is made when a container with a volume in it first starts), `sshfs` is not on the hub (`sudo apt install sshfs`, `sudo dnf install fuse-sshfs`; a hub whose DCS account has passwordless sudo installs it by itself), the VM's account does not take the hub's key (a VM you made yourself: put `.data/fleet-ssh/id_ed25519.pub` of the hub into its `authorized_keys`), or the hub's API runs as the systemd service without passwordless sudo (a mount it made would be invisible to your shell). **Mount** on the stack's page tries at once and answers with the reason. |
| An app shows an empty library after a host folder was shared into its VM | The container was started before the folder was mounted in the VM, so it still sees the empty folder underneath: restart the stack. If the folder is empty in the VM too, the VM has not been *started* since the Virtiofs device was added (shut it down and start it), or the mapping's name in `/etc/fstab` is not the one in *Directory Mappings*. |
| *Host folders* says the token lacks `Mapping.Modify` or `Mapping.Use` | The token needs the role PVEMappingAdmin on `/mapping/dir`: on the Proxmox host, `pveum acl modify /mapping/dir --users dcs@pve --roles PVEMappingAdmin` (your token's user), then open the sheet again. |
| *Host folders*: "The folder … does not exist on the Proxmox host" | The path is looked up on the Proxmox host, not in the VM. `zfs list` (the MOUNTPOINT column) or `ls /mnt` on the host shows what is there; a plain drive is mounted on the host first. |
| A shared folder says *waits for a VM restart* | A new device appears only after the VM is fully stopped and started (a reboot from inside the VM keeps the old hardware): *Shutdown*, then *Start*, on its card. |
| A file made in `VM-App-Data` cannot be written by the app | It belongs to root in the VM (the mount serves as root so every container's files can be read). Edit files in place — that keeps their owner — or `chown` the new file there to the user the container runs as. |
| A build is refused: *A guest named 'x' already exists on Proxmox (qemu 103 on pve)* | Proxmox holds a VM (or container) named like the stack — often one built by an earlier hub that was deleted. The hub never builds a twin, and a refused request queues nothing. Remove or rename the old guest on Proxmox (or link it from the Proxmox page if it still belongs to this hub); the setup wizard marks such a stack "VM 103 exists" and builds the others. |
| Setup stops on *Docker is not running* or *may not use Docker* | A fresh server: Docker installed but not started (Fedora does not start it), or your user outside the `docker` group. Setup offers both fixes and carries on; by hand: `sudo systemctl enable --now docker`, `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`, log out and back in (or `newgrp docker`), then `./setup.sh` again. |
| A hub on Fedora (set up by hand): a build stops at **Install** with *could not fetch the DCS bundle* or *this VM cannot reach the hub*, or the VMs cannot join | firewalld on the hub blocks the API port the VMs fetch DCS from and join on. The wizard and *New VM* warn about it before a build. Setup offers to open it; by hand: `sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=9876/tcp && sudo firewall-cmd --reload`, then *Retry*. |
| Fedora: containers cannot write their `App-Data`, Traefik cannot read the Docker socket | Fedora's own Docker package (moby-engine) confines containers with SELinux. Setup offers to run them the way Docker CE does (`--selinux-enabled` off in `/etc/sysconfig/docker`, then `sudo systemctl restart docker`); SELinux stays on for the rest of the system. Or keep it and add `:z` to every volume. |
| The dashboard is gone after a reboot of the hub | The API ran from setup, outside systemd. `sudo .scripts/install-service.sh` installs the boot services (setup 3.9.7 offers it). |
| Guests missing | *Only this node* is set, or they are templates (never listed). |
| `reset` refused for a container | Containers have no hardware reset; use *Reboot*. |
| The Terminal says *the hub cannot open a shell in* a VM | The hub reaches a VM's shell with its own ssh key as the VM's DCS account (`dcs`): a VM the hub built accepts it; one you made yourself needs the hub's public key (`.data/fleet-ssh/id_ed25519.pub` on the hub) in `~dcs/.ssh/authorized_keys`, and a VM that is off does not answer. The reason shown names which. |
| A stop shows as *VM stopped on its own* | The watcher only ignores changes DCS asked for in the last five minutes; a shutdown from the Proxmox UI or from inside the guest is reported, which is the point. |
| Feed never pulled | The proxy machine must reach `http://<target host>:9876` (or the dashboard URL): test with `curl` from there; check the token in the snippet; Traefik logs a provider error when it cannot fetch. |
| A route is missing from the feed | Its container publishes no host port, or only on `127.0.0.1`; the panel lists it under *skipped*. Add a `ports:` mapping. |
| A build fails at **Image** | *cannot hold imported images*: tick *Import* under Datacenter → Storage → local → Content (or give the token `Datastore.Allocate`). *download refused* / a 403 with `Sys.AccessNetwork`: the hub then downloads and uploads the image itself; give the token `Sys.AccessNetwork` on the node to let Proxmox download. |
| A build fails at **Create** | Proxmox's own message is in the log: `SDN.Use` on the bridge means the token lacks the role PVESDNUser; `Datastore.AllocateSpace` the role PVEDatastoreAdmin. |
| A build fails at **SSH** | The VM booted but never answered at its address: the bridge is not the hub's network, the gateway or prefix is wrong, or the address is taken. The Proxmox console of the VM shows cloud-init's log. |
| A build fails at **Install** with *cannot reach the internet* | The VM has no way out: the gateway does not answer, DNS fails, or (on a Proxmox host that also runs Docker) the forwarding policy dropped it. Fix the network, then *Retry*. |
| A build fails at **Install** with *could not fetch the DCS bundle* | The VM cannot reach the hub at `FLEET_SELF_URL` (a 403 means the build's join code expired — *Retry* renews it). |
| A build fails at **Join** | The VM installed DCS but its join never arrived: `FLEET_SELF_URL` must be the hub's address as the VM sees it; the VM's `~/.Docker-Compose-Skeleton-AIO/logs` says what it tried. |
| A build stops at **Stack** | The hub could not copy its `Stacks/<source>` into the VM over ssh (the VM's disk, or a folder the hub cannot read) — *Retry* copies again. A copy that landed but did not start says so in the log: open the VM on the VMs page and start it from there. |
| *The hub could not log in to http://…* on a join | The hub must reach the member's API at that address: a firewall, or a wrong detected address — set `FLEET_SELF_URL=http://<member ip>:9876` in the member's `.env` (or pass `url` on the join) and join again. |
| A build is refused: *runs on this server (the hub)* | The hub runs that stack itself: the message says whether it is in the hub's `DOCKER_STACKS` (take it out: Stacks page → order) or its containers are still up (a stop takes a moment — try again when the Stacks page shows it stopped). A bare `Stacks/<name>` folder never blocks a build. |
| A build is refused: *A guest named … already exists on Proxmox* | A VM or container already carries the stack's name. Link it from the Proxmox page if it is that stack's DCS, or rename it in Proxmox and build. |
| A build failed and its VM is still on Proxmox | *Retry* resumes the job (the VM is reused); *Dismiss* asks whether to destroy the VM as well (`DELETE /fleet/jobs/{id}?destroy=true`). |
| The join code is refused | Codes expire after 24 h (or the hours chosen) and are case-insensitive; mint a new one on the hub's Proxmox page. Five wrong codes from one address lock it out for a while, like logins. |
| A member shows *no guest matched* | No guest agent (uuid still works for a VM if the hub reads `smbios1`, but an LXC or a VM whose name differs from the hostname needs the address or the name to match): pick the guest from the member menu. |
| The scan finds nothing | The scan needs each guest's addresses from the QEMU guest agent (or container interfaces) and DCS answering on port 9876 there (`FLEET_SCAN_PORTS` for others). A VM without the agent shows *address unknown*. |
| A member's stacks are missing from the Proxmox page | *Members answering* in the page header says whether the hub reached it; the member menu's *Test* explains a refusal (a changed password on the member: edit the member and enter it again). |
| An update round says *the bundle could not be unpacked: … Function not implemented* | The member's `dcs-api.service` still carries `RestrictSUIDSGID=true` from an older installer; under it systemd answers tar's `openat2()` with ENOSYS on Fedora 44 (systemd 259). Run `sudo .scripts/install-service.sh` once on that VM and restart the service — every later round refreshes the unit by itself when the installer changes. |
| A VM's events do not show on the hub's Activity page or in its Discord/NTFY | The member has no relay token yet: the hub hands one out within a minute of the member answering (`.data/fleet-relay.json` on the hub); a member older than 3.9.0 gets it after an update round. Events raised while the hub was unreachable are not queued. |
| The dashboard container (DCS-UI) is *unhealthy* and its log says `socketpair() failed (13: Permission denied)` | Debian's own `docker.io` 26 with AppArmor 4.1 (Debian 13, and a Proxmox host) denies nginx its worker sockets. `setup.sh` detects that pairing and writes `DCS_UI_APPARMOR=unconfined` into `Stacks/core-infrastructure/.env`; on an install made before 3.9.1 add that line yourself and run `docker compose up -d dcs-ui` in that folder, or install Docker CE, which needs nothing. |
| A service inside a VM is not reachable through the hub's Traefik | The hub writes the members' routes into its Traefik's `custom_routes/fleet-members.yml` every half minute (audit entry `fleet_routes`); the member must answer, its container must carry Traefik labels, and the hub's Traefik must reach the VM's address (same bridge, no firewall in between). The feed for a Traefik elsewhere is separate (section 4). |
| A VM's RAM shows near 100 % on the Proxmox page while the guest is idle | Without a memory balloon Proxmox reports the host's view of the VM (its whole allocation, once the page cache fills). VMs the hub builds get a balloon (three quarters of the memory kept); for an older one use *Enable ballooning* in the VM's sheet (or `qm set <vmid> --balloon <half>`) and reboot it. |
| A service in a VM answers without the Authelia portal | The hub's Traefik puts VM routes behind Authelia when Authelia is deployed on the hub; templates whose apps bring their own clients (`"auth": "bypass"` in their `template.json`) stay open on purpose. The deploy sheet's per-route switch decides otherwise. |
| A service deployed into a VM has no route | The VM had no domain when the service was deployed: the hub hands the domain out within a minute (audit `fleet_domain`), and the member writes the missing routes then; *Rebuild routes* (`POST /traefik/routes/rebuild`) does it by hand. |
| A Fedora VM does not answer after a reboot; `journalctl -u dcs-api` says `203/EXEC` | SELinux: the updated script lost its `bin_t` label (fixed in 3.9.1, the update relabels). By hand: `chcon -t bin_t ~/.Docker-Compose-Skeleton-AIO/.scripts/api-server.sh && sudo systemctl restart dcs-api`; `dnf install policycoreutils-python-utils` and `./.scripts/install-service.sh` make the rule persistent. |
| A VM's own Updates page says *Updated by its hub* | By design: a VM built by the hub has no git checkout, its code comes from the hub's Updates page (*Update all VMs*). |
| Detection says nothing about Proxmox | Detection reads `systemd-detect-virt` and the DMI vendor; a VM without the guest agent still shows as *QEMU/KVM*, which is treated as a probable Proxmox VM. The probe looks for port 8006 on the default gateway and on `pve`, `proxmox`, `pve.local`, `proxmox.local`; if your host has another name, just type the URL. |
