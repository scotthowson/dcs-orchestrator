#!/bin/bash
# =============================================================================
# api-dispatch.sh — the front of the API when it runs with worker processes.
#
# socat starts this for every connection, with the client on stdin / stdout.
# It reads the request (the line, the headers, the body the Content-Length
# announces: what the API reads itself, with the same 10 s patience), then
# hands it to one of the worker processes the server keeps — each one is
# api-server.sh, read once, listening on its own unix socket — with the
# client's address in front. A busy worker refuses the connection at once, so
# the next one is tried with the same request.
#
# The pool is a fast path, never a queue: a request that stays open (an event
# stream is open for as long as a dashboard is) and a request that finds every
# worker busy for a second (a slow call each, say to a VM that does not answer)
# are served by a process of their own, the way every request was before the pool.
# Written to be tiny: bash reads it in a millisecond, where the API script
# takes a tenth of a second on a small VM.
